      CHAPTER I. THE WAR MEETING
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Town Hall in Rossville stands on a moderate elevation overlooking the
      principal street. It is generally open only when a meeting has been called
      by the Selectmen to transact town business, or occasionally in the evening
      when a lecture on temperance or a political address is to be delivered.
      Rossville is not large enough to sustain a course of lyceum lectures, and
      the townspeople are obliged to depend for intellectual nutriment upon such
      chance occasions as these. The majority of the inhabitants being engaged
      in agricultural pursuits, the population is somewhat scattered, and the
      houses, with the exception of a few grouped around the stores, stand at
      respectable distances, each encamped on a farm of its own.
    </p>
    <p>
      One Wednesday afternoon, toward the close of September, 1862, a group of
      men and boys might have been seen standing on the steps and in the entry
      of the Town House. Why they had met will best appear from a large placard,
      which had been posted up on barns and fences and inside the village store
      and postoffice.
    </p>
    <p>
      It ran as follows:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     WAR MEETING!
</pre>
    <p>
      The citizens of Rossville are invited to meet at the Town Hall, on
      Wednesday, September 24, at 3 P. M. to decide what measures shall be taken
      toward raising the town's quota of twenty-five men, under the recent call
      of the President of the United States. All patriotic citizens, who are in
      favor of sustaining the free institutions transmitted to us by our
      fathers, are urgently invited to be present.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Hon. Solomon Stoddard is expected to address the meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Come one, come all.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the appointed hour one hundred and fifty men had assembled in the hall.
      They stood in groups, discussing the recent call and the general
      management of the war with that spirit of independent criticism which so
      eminently characterizes the little democracies which make up our New
      England States.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The whole thing has been mismanaged from the first,&rdquo; remarked a
      sapient-looking man with a gaunt, cadaverous face, addressing two
      listeners. &ldquo;The Administration is corrupt; our generals are either
      incompetent or purposely inefficient. We haven't got an officer that can
      hold a candle to General Lee. Abraham Lincoln has called for six hundred
      thousand men. What'll he do with 'em when he gets 'em? Just nothing at
      all. They'll melt away like snow, and then he'll call for more men. Give
      me a third of six hundred thousand, and I'll walk into Richmond in less'n
      thirty days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A quiet smile played over the face of one of the listeners. With a slight
      shade of irony in his voice he said, &ldquo;If such are your convictions, Mr.
      Holman, I think it a great pity that you are not in the service. We need
      those who have clear views of what is required in the present emergency.
      Don't you intend to volunteer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I!&rdquo; exclaimed the other with lofty scorn. &ldquo;No, sir; I wash my hands of
      the whole matter. I ain't clear about the justice of warring upon our
      erring brethren at all. I have no doubt they would be inclined to accept
      overtures of peace if accompanied with suitable concessions. Still, if war
      must be waged, I believe I could manage matters infinitely better than
      Lincoln and his cabinet have done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wouldn't it be well to give them the benefit of your ideas on the
      subject?&rdquo; suggested the other quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ahem!&rdquo; said Mr. Holman, a little suspiciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean, Mr. Frost?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only this, that if, like you, I had a definite scheme, which I thought
      likely to terminate the war, I should feel it my duty to communicate it to
      the proper authorities, that they might take it into consideration.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wouldn't do any good,&rdquo; returned Holman, still a little suspicious that
      he was quietly laughed at. &ldquo;They're too set in their own ways to be
      changed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment there was a sharp rap on the table, and a voice was heard,
      saying, &ldquo;The meeting will please come to order.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The buzz of voices died away; and all eyes were turned toward the
      speaker's stand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be necessary to select a chairman to preside over your
      deliberations,&rdquo; was next heard. &ldquo;Will any one nominate?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I nominate Doctor Plunkett,&rdquo; came from a man in the corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      The motion was seconded, and a show of hands resulted in favor of the
      nominee.
    </p>
    <p>
      A gentlemanly-looking man with a pleasant face advanced to the speaker's
      stand, and with a bow made a few remarks to this effect:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fellow citizens: This is new business to me, as you are doubtless aware.
      My professional engagements have not often allowed me to take part in the
      meetings which from time to time you have held in this hall. On the
      present occasion, however, I felt it to be my duty, and the duty of every
      loyal citizen, to show by his presence how heartily he approves the object
      which has called us together. The same consideration will not suffer me to
      decline the unexpected responsibility which you have devolved upon me.
      Before proceeding farther, I would suggest that a clerk will be needed to
      complete the organization.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A young man was nominated and elected without opposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doctor Plunkett again addressed the meeting: &ldquo;It is hardly necessary,&rdquo; he
      said, &ldquo;to remind you of the object which has brought us together. Our
      forces in the field need replenishing. The Rebellion has assumed more
      formidable proportions than we anticipated. It is quite clear that we
      cannot put it down with one hand. We shall need both. Impressed with this
      conviction, President Lincoln has made an extraordinary levy upon the
      country. He feels that it is desirable to put down the Rebellion as
      speedily as possible, and not suffer it to drag through a series of years.
      But he cannot work single-handed. The loyal States must give their hearty
      cooperation. Our State, though inferior in extent and population to some
      others, has not fallen behind in loyal devotion. Nor, I believe, will
      Rossville be found wanting in this emergency. Twenty-five men have been
      called for. How shall we get them? This is the question which we are
      called upon to consider. I had hoped the Honorable Solomon Stoddard would
      be here to address you; but I regret to learn that a temporary illness
      will prevent his doing so. I trust that those present will not be backward
      in expressing their opinions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Holman was already on his feet. His speech consisted of disconnected
      remarks on the general conduct of the war, mingled with severe
      denunciation of the Administration.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had spoken for fifteen minutes in this strain, when the chairman
      interfered&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your remarks are out of order, Mr. Holman. They are entirely irrelevant
      to the question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Holman wiped his cadaverous features with a red silk pocket-handkerchief,
      and inquired, sarcastically, &ldquo;Am I to understand that freedom of speech is
      interdicted in this hall?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Freedom of speech is in order,&rdquo; said the chairman calmly, &ldquo;provided the
      speaker confines himself to the question under discussion. You have spoken
      fifteen minutes without once touching it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you want me to praise the Administration,&rdquo; said Holman,
      evidently thinking that he had demolished the chairman. He looked around
      to observe what effect his shot had produced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would be equally out of order,&rdquo; ruled the presiding officer. &ldquo;We
      have not assembled to praise or to censure the Administration, but to
      consider in what manner we shall go to work to raise our quota.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Holman sat down with the air of a martyr.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Frost rose next. It is unnecessary to report his speech. It was plain,
      practical, and to the point. He recommended that the town appropriate a
      certain sum as bounty money to volunteers. Other towns had done so, and he
      thought with good reason. It would undoubtedly draw in recruits more
      rapidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      A short, stout, red-faced man, wearing gold spectacles, rose hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Chairman,&rdquo; he commenced, &ldquo;I oppose that suggestion. I think it
      calculated to work serious mischief. Do our young men need to be hired to
      fight for their country? I suppose that is what you call patriotism. For
      my part, I trust the town will have too much good sense to agree to any
      such proposition. The consequence of it would be to plunge us into debt,
      and increase our taxes to a formidable amount.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It may be remarked that Squire Haynes, the speaker, was the wealthiest man
      in town, and, of course, would be considerably affected by increased
      taxation. Even now he never paid his annual tax-bill without an inward
      groan, feeling that it was so much deducted from the sum total of his
      property.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Frost remained standing while Squire Haynes was speaking, and at the
      close continued his speech:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Squire Haynes objects that my proposition, if adopted, will make our
      taxes heavier. I grant it: but how can we expect to carry on this gigantic
      war without personal sacrifices? If they only come in the form of money,
      we may account ourselves fortunate. I take it for granted that there is
      not a man here present who does not approve the present war&mdash;who does
      not feel that we are waging it for good and sufficient reasons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here Mr. Holman moved uneasily in his seat, and seemed on the point of
      interrupting the speaker, but for some reason forbore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such being the case, we cannot but feel that the burden ought to fall
      upon the entire community, and not wholly upon any particular portion. The
      heaviest sacrifices must undoubtedly be made by those who leave their
      homes and peril life and limb on the battlefield. When I propose that you
      should lighten that sacrifice so far as it lies in your power, by voting
      them a bounty, it is because I consider that money will compensate them
      for the privations they must encounter and the perils they will incur. For
      that, they must look to the satisfaction that will arise from the feeling
      that they have responded to their country's call, and done something to
      save from ruin the institutions which our fathers transmitted as a sacred
      trust to their descendants. Money cannot pay for loss of life or limb. But
      some of them leave families behind. It is not right that these families
      should suffer because the fathers have devoted themselves to the sacred
      cause of liberty. When our soldiers go forth, enable them to feel that
      their wives and children shall not lack for the necessaries of life. The
      least that those who are privileged to stay at home can do is to tax their
      purses for this end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Chairman,&rdquo; said Squire Haynes sarcastically, &ldquo;I infer that the last
      speaker is intending to enlist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Frost's face flushed at this insinuation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Squire Haynes chooses to impute to me interested motives. I need enter
      into no defense before an audience to whom I am well known. I will only
      inquire whether interested motives have nothing to do with his opposition
      to voting bounties to our soldiers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was such a palpable hit that Squire Haynes winced under it, and his
      red face turned redder as he saw the smiles of those about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impudent puppy!&rdquo; he muttered to himself; &ldquo;he seems to forget that I have
      a mortgage of eight hundred dollars on his farm. When the time comes to
      foreclose it, I will show him no mercy. I'll sell him out, root and
      branch!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Frost could not read the thoughts that were passing through the mind
      of his creditor. They might have given him a feeling of uneasiness, but
      would not in the least have influenced his action. He was a man loyal to
      his own convictions of duty, and no apprehension of personal loss would
      have prevented his speaking in accordance with what he felt to be right.
    </p>
    <p>
      The considerations which had been urged were so reasonable that the voters
      present, with very little opposition, voted to pay one hundred and fifty
      dollars to each one who was willing to enlist as one of the town's quota.
      A list was at once opened, and after the close of the meeting four young
      men came forward and put down their names, amid the applause of the
      assembly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wanted to do it before,&rdquo; said John Drake, one of the number, to Mr.
      Frost, &ldquo;but I've got a wife and two little children dependent upon me for
      support. I couldn't possibly support them out of my thirteen dollars a
      month, even with the State aid. But your motion has decided me. I could do
      better by staying at home, even with that; but that isn't the question. I
      want to help my country in this hour of her need; and now that my mind is
      at ease about my family, I shall cheerfully enter the service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I know of no one who will make a better soldier!&rdquo; said Mr. Frost
      heartily.

      CHAPTER II. THE PRIZE
    </h2>
    <p>
      A few rods distant from the Town Hall, but on the opposite side of the
      street, stood the Rossville Academy. It had been for some years under the
      charge of James Rathburn, A. M., a thorough scholar and a skilful teacher.
      A large part of his success was due to his ability in making the ordinary
      lessons of the schoolroom interesting to his scholars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some forty students attended the academy, mostly from the town of
      Rossville. Mr. Rathburn, however, received a few boarders into his family.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were three classes in the Latin language; but the majority of those
      who had taken it up stopped short before they had gone beyond the Latin
      Reader. One class, however, had commenced reading the Aeneid of Virgil,
      and was intending to pursue the full course of preparation for college;
      though in regard to one member of the class there was some doubt whether
      he would be able to enter college. As this boy is to be our hero we will
      take a closer look at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank Frost is at this time in his sixteenth year. He is about the medium
      size, compactly made, and the healthful color in his cheeks is good
      evidence that he is not pursuing his studies at the expense of his health.
      He has dark chestnut hair, with a slight wave, and is altogether a
      fine-looking boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a desk behind him sits John Haynes, the son of Squire Haynes,
      introduced in our last chapter. He is nearly two years older than Frank,
      and about as opposite to him in personal appearance as can well be
      imagined. He has a thin face, very black hair is tall of his age, and
      already beginning to feel himself a young man. His manner is full of
      pretension. He never forgets that his father is the richest man in town,
      and can afford to give him advantages superior to those possessed by his
      schoolfellows. He has a moderate share of ability but is disinclined to
      work hard. His affectation of Superiority makes him as unpopular among his
      schoolfellows as Frank is popular.
    </p>
    <p>
      These two boys, together with Henry Tufts, constitute the preparatory
      class of Rossville Academy. Henry is mild in his manners, and a
      respectable student, but possesses no positive character. He comes from a
      town ten miles distant, and boards with the principal. Frank, though the
      youngest of the three, excels the other two in scholarship. But there is
      some doubt whether he will be able to go to college. His father is in
      moderate circumstances, deriving a comfortable subsistence from a small
      farm, but is able to lay by a very small surplus every year, and this he
      feels it necessary to hold in reserve for the liquidation of the mortgage
      held by Squire Haynes. Frank's chance of attaining what he covets-a
      college education-seems small; but he is resolved at least to prepare for
      college, feeling that even this will constitute a very respectable
      education.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reader is introduced to the main schoolroom of the Rossville Academy
      on the morning of the day of which the war meeting takes place.
    </p>
    <p>
      At nine o'clock the bell rang, and the scholars took their seats. After
      the preliminary devotional exercise, Mr. Rathburn, instead of calling up
      the first class at once, paused a moment, and spoke as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Scholars, I need not remind you that on the first day of the term, with
      the design of encouraging you to aim at improvement in English
      composition, I offered two prizes-one for the best essay written by a boy
      over fourteen years of age; the other for the best composition by any one
      under that age. It gives me pleasure to state that in most of those
      submitted to me I recognize merit, and I should be glad if it were in my
      power to give three times as many prizes. Those of you, however, who are
      unsuccessful will feel repaid by the benefit you have yourselves derived
      from the efforts you have made for another end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      During this address, John Haynes looked about him with an air of
      complacency and importance. He felt little doubt that his own essay on the
      &ldquo;Military Genius of Napoleon&rdquo; would win the prize. He did not so much care
      for this, except for the credit it would give him. But his father, who was
      ambitious for him, had promised him twenty-five dollars if he succeeded,
      and he had already appropriated this sum in imagination. He had determined
      to invest it in a handsome boat which he had seen for sale in Boston on
      his last visit to that city.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After careful consideration,&rdquo; continued the teacher, &ldquo;I have decided that
      the prize should be adjudged to an essay entitled 'The Duties of Boys on
      the Present National Crisis,' written by Frank Frost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a general clapping of hands at this announcement. Frank was a
      general favorite, and even his disappointed rivals felt a degree of
      satisfaction in feeling that he had obtained the prize.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was one exception, however. John Haynes turned pale, and then red,
      with anger and vexation. He scowled darkly while the rest of the boys were
      applauding, and persuaded himself that he was the victim of a great piece
      of injustice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank's face flushed with pleasure, and his eyes danced with delight. He
      had made a great effort to succeed, and he knew that at home they would be
      very happy to hear that the prize had been awarded to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frank Frost will come forward,&rdquo; said Mr. Rathburn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank left his seat, and advanced modestly. Mr. Rathburn placed in his
      hand a neat edition of Whittier's Poem's in blue and gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let this serve as an incentive to renewed effort,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second prize was awarded to one of the girls. As she has no part in
      our story, we need say nothing more on this point.
    </p>
    <p>
      At recess, Frank's desk was surrounded by his schoolmates, who were
      desirous of examining the prize volumes. All expressed hearty good-will,
      congratulating him on his success, with the exception of John Haynes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem mighty proud of your books, Frank Frost,&rdquo; said he with a sneer.
      &ldquo;We all know that you're old Rathburn's favorite. It didn't make much
      difference what you wrote, as long as you were sure of the prize.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For shame, John Haynes!&rdquo; exclaimed little Harvey Grover impetuously. &ldquo;You
      only say that because you wanted the prize yourself, and you're
      disappointed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Disappointed!&rdquo; retorted John scornfully. &ldquo;I don't want any of old
      Rathburn's sixpenny books. I can buy as many as I please. If he'd given
      'em to me, I should have asked him to keep 'em for those who needed 'em
      more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frank was justly indignant at the unfriendly course which John chose to
      pursue, but feeling that it proceeded from disappointed rivalry, he wisely
      said nothing to increase his exasperation. He put the two books carefully
      away in his desk, and settled himself quietly to his day's lessons.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not until evening that John and his father met. Both had been
      chafed&mdash;the first by his disappointment, the second by the failure of
      his effort to prevent the town's voting bounties to volunteers. In
      particular he was incensed with Mr. Frost, for his imputation of
      interested motives, although it was only in return for a similar
      imputation brought against himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, father, I didn't get the prize,&rdquo; commenced John, in a discontented
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much the worse for you,&rdquo; said his father coldly. &ldquo;You might have
      gained it if you had made an effort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I couldn't. Rathburn was sure to give it to his favorite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who is his favorite?&rdquo; questioned Squire Haynes, not yet siding with
      his son.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frank Frost, to be sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frank Frost!&rdquo; repeated the squire, rapidly wheeling round to his son's
      view of the matter. His dislike of the father was so great that it readily
      included the son. &ldquo;What makes you think he is the teacher's favorite?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Rathburn is always praising him for something or other. All the boys
      know Frank Frost is his pet. You won't catch him praising me, if I work
      ever so hard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John did not choose to mention that he had not yet tried this method of
      securing the teacher's approval.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Teachers should never have favorites,&rdquo; said the squire dogmatically. &ldquo;It
      is highly detrimental to a teacher's influence, and subversive of the
      principles of justice. Have you got your essay with you, John?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may sit down and read it to me, and if I think it deserving, I will
      take care that you sha'n't lose by the teacher's injustice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John readily obeyed. He hurried up to his chamber, and, opening his
      writing-desk, took out a sheet of foolscap, three sides of which were
      written over. This he brought down-stairs with him. He began to hope that
      he might get the boat after all.
    </p>
    <p>
      The squire, in dressing-gown and slippers, sat in a comfortable armchair,
      while John in a consequential manner read his rejected essay. It was
      superficial and commonplace, and abundantly marked with pretension, but to
      the squire's warped judgment it seemed to have remarkable merit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It does you great credit, John,&rdquo; said he emphatically. &ldquo;I don't know what
      sort of an essay young Frost wrote, but I venture to say it was not as
      good. If he's anything like his father, he is an impertinent jackanapes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John pricked up his ears, and listened attentively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He grossly insulted me at the town meeting to-day, and I sha'n't soon
      forget it. It isn't for his interest to insult a man who has the power to
      annoy him that I possess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven't you got a mortgage on his farm?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and at a proper time I shall remind him of it. But to come back to
      your own affairs. What was the prize given to young Frost?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A blue-and-gold copy of Whittier's Poems, in two volumes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plain binding, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. The next time I go to Boston, I will buy you the same thing
      bound in calf. I don't intend that you shall suffer by your teacher's
      injustice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wasn't so much the prize that I cared for,&rdquo; said John, who felt like
      making the most of his father's favorable mood, &ldquo;but you know you promised
      me twenty-five dollars if I gained it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And as you have been defrauded of it, I will give you thirty instead,&rdquo;
       said the squire promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      John's eyes sparkled with delight. &ldquo;Oh, thank you, sir!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
      wouldn't change places with Frank Frost now for all his prize.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think not, indeed,&rdquo; said the squire pompously. &ldquo;Your position as
      the son of a poor farmer wouldn't be quite so high as it is now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke he glanced complacently at the handsome furniture which
      surrounded him, the choice engravings which hung on the walls, and the
      full-length mirror in which his figure was reflected. &ldquo;Ten years from now
      Frank Frost will be only a common laborer on his father's farm&mdash;that
      is,&rdquo; he added significantly, &ldquo;if his father manages to keep it; while you,
      I hope, will be winning distinction at the bar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Father and son were in a congenial mood that evening, and a common hatred
      drew them more closely together than mutual affection had ever done. They
      were very much alike&mdash;both cold, calculating, and selfish. The squire
      was indeed ambitious for his son, but could hardly be said to love him,
      since he was incapable of feeling a hearty love for any one except
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for John, it is to be feared that he regarded his father chiefly as one
      from whom he might expect future favors. His mother had been a good,
      though not a strong-minded woman, and her influence might have been of
      advantage to her son; but unhappily she had died when John was in his
      tenth year, and since then he had become too much like his father.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III. FRANK AT HOME
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Frost's farm was situated about three-quarters of a mile from the
      village. It comprised fifty acres, of which twenty were suitable for
      tillage, the remainder being about equally divided between woodland and
      pasture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Frost had for some years before his marriage been a painter, and had
      managed to save up from his earnings not far from a thousand dollars.
      Thinking, however, that farming would be more favorable to health, he
      purchased his fifty-acre farm for twenty-eight hundred dollars, payable
      one thousand down, and the rest remaining on mortgage. At the date of our
      story he had succeeded in paying up the entire amount within eight hundred
      dollars, a mortgage for that amount being held by Squire Haynes. He had
      not been able to accomplish this without strict economy, in which his wife
      had cheerfully aided him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But his family had grown larger and more expensive. Besides Frank, who was
      the oldest, there were now three younger children&mdash;Alice, twelve
      years of age; Maggie, ten; and Charlie, seven.
    </p>
    <p>
      The farmhouse was small but comfortable, and the family had never been
      tempted to sigh for a more costly or luxurious home. They were happy and
      contented, and this made their home attractive.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the evening succeeding that of the war meeting, Frank was seated in the
      common sitting-room with his father and mother. There was a well-worn
      carpet on the floor, a few plain chairs were scattered about the room, and
      in the corner ticked one of the old-fashioned clocks such as used to be
      the pride of our New England households. In the center of the room stood a
      round table, on which had been set a large kerosene-lamp, which diffused a
      cheerful light about the apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      On a little table, over which hung a small mirror, were several papers and
      magazines. Economical in most things, Mr. Frost was considered by many of
      his neighbors extravagant in this. He subscribed regularly for Harper's
      Magazine and Weekly, a weekly agricultural paper, a daily paper, and a
      child's magazine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't see how you can afford to buy so much reading-matter,&rdquo; said a
      neighbor, one day. &ldquo;It must cost you a sight of money. As for me, I only
      take a weekly paper, and I think I shall have to give that up soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All my papers and magazines cost me in a year, including postage, is less
      than twenty dollars,&rdquo; said Mr. Frost quietly. &ldquo;A very slight additional
      economy in dress&mdash;say three dollars a year to each of us will pay
      that. I think my wife would rather make her bonnet wear doubly as long
      than give up a single one of our papers. When you think of the comparative
      amount of pleasure given by a paper that comes to you fifty-two times in a
      year, and a little extra extravagance in dress, I think you will decide in
      favor of the paper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But when you've read it, you haven't anything to show for your money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when clothes are worn out you may say the same of them. But we value
      both for the good they have done, and the pleasure they have afforded. I
      have always observed that a family where papers and magazines are taken is
      much more intelligent and well informed than where their bodies are
      clothed at the expense of their minds. Our daily paper is the heaviest
      item; but I like to know what is passing in the world, and, besides, I
      think I more than defray the expense by the knowledge I obtain of the
      markets. At what price did you sell your apples last year?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At one dollar and seventy-five cents per barrel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I sold forty barrels at two dollars per barrel. I found from my paper
      that there was reason to expect an increase in the price, and held on. By
      so doing I gained ten dollars, which more than paid the expense of my
      paper for the year. So even in a money way I was paid for my subscription.
      No, neighbor, though I have good reason to economize, I don't care to
      economize in that direction. I want my children to grow up intelligent
      citizens. Let me advise you, instead of stopping your only paper, to
      subscribe for two or three more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; was the irresolute reply. &ldquo;It was pretty lucky about the
      apples; but it seems a good deal to pay. As for my children, they don't
      get much time to read. They've got to earn their livin', and that ain't
      done by settin' down and readin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not so sure of that,&rdquo; said Mr. Frost. &ldquo;Education often enables a man
      to make money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The reader may have been surprised at the ease with which Mr. Frost
      expressed himself in his speech at the war meeting. No other explanation
      is required than that he was in the habit of reading, every day,
      well-selected newspapers. &ldquo;A man is known by the company he keeps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you gained the prize, Frank?&rdquo; said his father approvingly. &ldquo;I am very
      glad to hear it. It does you great credit. I hope none were envious of
      your success.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most of the boys seemed glad of it,&rdquo; was the reply; &ldquo;but John Haynes was
      angry because he didn't get it himself. He declared that I succeeded only
      because I was a favorite with Mr. Rathburn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid he has not an amiable disposition. However, we must remember
      that his home influences haven't been the best. His mother's death was
      unfortunate for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard at the store that you and Squire Haynes had a discussion at the
      war meeting,&rdquo; said Frank inquiringly. &ldquo;How was it, father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was on the question of voting a bounty to our volunteers. I felt that
      such a course would be only just. The squire objected on the ground that
      our taxes would be considerably increased.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how did the town vote?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They sustained my proposition, much to the squire's indignation. He
      doesn't seem to feel that any sacrifices ought to be expected of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the prospect of obtaining the men, father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Four have already enlisted, but twenty-one are still required. I fear
      there will be some difficulty in obtaining the full number. In a farming
      town like ours the young men are apt to go off to other places as soon as
      they are old enough; so that the lot must fall upon some who have
      families.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frank sat for some minutes gazing thoughtfully into the wood-fire that
      crackled in the fireplace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I was old enough to go, father,&rdquo; he said, at length.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you were,&rdquo; said his father earnestly. &ldquo;Not that it wouldn't be
      hard to send you out into the midst of perils; but our duty to our country
      ought to be paramount to our personal preferences.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's another reason,&rdquo; he said, after awhile, &ldquo;why I wish you were
      older. You could take my place on the farm, and leave me free to enlist. I
      should have no hesitation in going. I have not forgotten that my
      grandfather fought at Bunker Hill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, father,&rdquo; said Frank, nodding; &ldquo;and that's his musket that hangs
      up in your room, isn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; it was his faithful companion for three years. I often think with
      pride of his services. I have been trying to think all day whether I
      couldn't make some arrangement to have the farm carried on in my absence;
      but it is very hard to obtain a person in whom I could confide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I were as good a manager as some,&rdquo; said Mrs. Frost, with a smile, &ldquo;I
      would offer to be your farmer; but I am afraid that, though my intentions
      would be the best, things would go on badly under my administration.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have enough to do in the house, Mary,&rdquo; said her husband. &ldquo;I should
      not wish you to undertake the additional responsibility, even if you were
      thoroughly competent. I am afraid I shall have to give up the idea of
      going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Frost took up the evening paper. Frank continued to look thoughtfully
      into the fire, as if revolving something in his mind. Finally he rose, and
      lighting a candle went up to bed. But he did not go to sleep for some
      time. A plan had occurred to him, and he was considering its feasibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I could do it,&rdquo; he said, at last, turning over and composing
      himself to sleep. &ldquo;I'll speak to father the first thing to-morrow
      morning.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER IV. FRANK MAKES A PROPOSITION
    </h2>
    <p>
      When Frank woke the next morning the sun was shining into his window. He
      rubbed his eyes and tried to think what it was that occupied his mind the
      night before. It came to him in a moment, and jumping out of bed, he
      dressed himself with unusual expedition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hurrying down-stairs, he found his mother in the kitchen, busily engaged
      in getting breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where's father?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He hasn't come in from the barn yet, Frank,&rdquo; his mother answered. &ldquo;You
      can have your breakfast now, if you are in a hurry to get to studying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind, just now, mother,&rdquo; returned Frank. &ldquo;I want to speak to father
      about something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Taking his cap from the nail in the entry where it usually hung, Frank
      went out to the barn. He found that his father was nearly through milking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is breakfast ready?&rdquo; asked Mr. Frost, looking up. &ldquo;Tell your mother she
      needn't wait for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn't ready yet,&rdquo; said Frank. &ldquo;I came out because I want to speak to
      you about something very particular.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, Frank, Go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if you don't think it a good plan, or think that I am foolish in
      speaking of it, don't say anything to anybody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Frost looked at Frank in some little curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; he said, smiling, &ldquo;like our neighbor Holman, you have formed a
      plan for bringing the war to a close.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frank laughed. &ldquo;I am not quite so presumptuous,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You remember
      saying last night, that if I were old enough to take charge of the farm,
      you would have no hesitation in volunteering?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you think I am old enough?&rdquo; asked Frank eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you are only fifteen, Frank,&rdquo; returned his father, in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it, but I am strong enough to do considerable work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn't so much that which is required. A man could easily be found to
      do the hardest of the work. But somebody is needed who understands
      farming, and is qualified to give directions. How much do you know of
      that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not much at present,&rdquo; answered Frank modestly, &ldquo;but I think I could learn
      easily. Besides, there's Mr. Maynard, who is a good farmer, could advise
      me whenever I was in doubt, and you could write home directions in your
      letters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; said Mr. Frost thoughtfully. &ldquo;I will promise to give it
      careful consideration. But have you thought that you will be obliged to
      give up attending school.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, of course, that will put you back; your class-mates will get in
      advance of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have thought of that, father, and I shall be very sorry for it. But I
      think that is one reason why I desire the plan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't understand you, Frank,&rdquo; said his father, a little puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, father, it would require a sacrifice on my part, and I should
      feel glad to think I had an opportunity of making a sacrifice for the sake
      of my country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the right spirit, Frank,&rdquo; said his father approvingly. &ldquo;That's the
      way my grandfather felt and acted, and it's the way I like to see my son
      feel. So it would be a great sacrifice to me to leave you all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And to us to be parted from you, father,&rdquo; said Frank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no doubt of it, my dear boy,&rdquo; said his father kindly. &ldquo;We have
      always been a happy and united family, and, please God, we always shall
      be. But this plan of yours requires consideration. I will talk it over
      with your mother and Mr. Maynard, and will then come to a decision.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was afraid you would laugh at me,&rdquo; said Frank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said his father, &ldquo;it was a noble thought, and does you credit. I
      shall feel that, whatever course I may think it wisest to adopt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sound of a bell from the house reached them. This meant breakfast. Mr.
      Frost had finished milking, and with a well-filled pail in either hand,
      went toward the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Move the milking:-stool, Frank,&rdquo; he said, looking behind him, &ldquo;or the cow
      will kick it over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Five minutes later they were at breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have some news for you, Mary,&rdquo; said Mr. Frost, as he helped his wife to
      a sausage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo; said she, looking up inquiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some one has offered to take charge of the farm for me, in case I wish to
      go out as a soldier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Frost, with strong interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A gentleman with whom you are well&mdash;I may say intimately
      acquainted,&rdquo; was the smiling response.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn't Mr. Maynard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. It is some one that lives nearer than he.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can that be? He is our nearest neighbor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you can't guess?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I am quite mystified.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose I should say that it is your oldest son?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, Frank?&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Frost, turning from her husband to her son,
      whose flushed face indicated how anxious he was about his mother's
      favorable opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have hit it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were not in earnest, Frank?&rdquo; said Mrs. Frost inquiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think he was. He certainly appeared to be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what does Frank know about farming?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I asked him that question myself. He admitted that he didn't know much at
      present, but thought that, with Mr. Maynard's advice, he might get along.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Frost was silent a moment. &ldquo;It will be a great undertaking,&rdquo; she
      said, at last; &ldquo;but if you think you can trust Frank, I will do all I can
      to help him. I can't bear to think of having you go, yet I am conscious
      that this is a feeling which I have no right to indulge at the expense of
      my country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said her husband seriously. &ldquo;I feel that I owe my country a service
      which I have no right to delegate to another, as long as I am able to
      discharge it myself. I shall reflect seriously upon Frank's proposition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no more said at this time. Both Frank and his parents felt that
      it was a serious matter, and not to be hastily decided.
    </p>
    <p>
      After breakfast Frank went up-stairs, and before studying his Latin
      lesson, read over thoughtfully the following passage in his prize essay on
      &ldquo;The Duties of American Boys at the Present Crisis:&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now that so large a number of our citizens have been withdrawn from their
      families and their ordinary business to engage in putting down this
      Rebellion, it becomes the duty of the boys to take their places as far as
      they are able to do so. A boy cannot wholly supply the place of a man, but
      he can do so in part. And where he is not called on to do this, he can so
      conduct himself that his friends who are absent may feel at ease about
      him. He ought to feel willing to give up some pleasures, if by so doing he
      can help to supply the places of those who are gone. If he does this
      voluntarily, and in the right spirit, he is just as patriotic as if he
      were a soldier in the field.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't think,&rdquo; thought Frank, &ldquo;when I wrote this, how soon my words
      would come back to me. It isn't much to write the words. The thing is to
      stand by them. If father should decide to go, I will do my best, and then,
      when the Rebellion is over, I shall feel that I did something, even if It
      wasn't much, toward putting it down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frank put his essay carefully away in a bureau drawer in which he kept his
      clothes, and, spreading open his Latin lexicon, proceeded to prepare his
      lesson in the third book of Virgil's Aeneid.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V. MR. RATHBURN MAKES A SPEECH
    </h2>
    <p>
      Frank's seat in the schoolroom was directly in front of that occupied by
      John Haynes. Until the announcement of the prize John and he had been on
      friendly terms. They belonged to the same class in Latin, and Frank had
      often helped his classmate through a difficult passage which he had not
      the patience to construe for himself. Now, however, a coolness grew up
      between them, originating with John. He felt envious of Frank's success;
      and this feeling brought with it a certain bitterness which found
      gratification in anything which he had reason to suppose would annoy
      Frank.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the morning succeeding the distribution of the prizes, Frank arrived at
      the schoolhouse a few minutes before the bell rang. John, with half a
      dozen other boys, stood near the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      John took off his hat with mock deference. &ldquo;Make way for the great prize
      essayist, gentlemen!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The modern Macaulay is approaching.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frank colored with annoyance. John did not fail to notice this with
      pleasure. He was sorry, however, that none of the other boys seemed
      inclined to join in the demonstration. In fact, they liked Frank much the
      better of the two.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That isn't quite fair, John,&rdquo; said Frank, in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am always glad to pay my homage to distinguished talent,&rdquo; John
      proceeded, in the same tone. &ldquo;I feel how presumptuous I was in venturing
      to compete with a gentleman of such genius!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to insult me?&rdquo; asked Frank, growing angry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear, no! I am only expressing my high opinion of your talents!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him alone, John!&rdquo; said Dick Jones, &ldquo;It isn't his fault that the
      teacher awarded the prize to him instead of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you don't think I care for that!&rdquo; said John, snapping his fingers.
      &ldquo;He's welcome to his rubbishing books; they don't amount to much, anyway.
      I don't believe they cost more than two dollars at the most. If you'd like
      to see what I got for my essay, I'll show you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John pulled out his portemonnaie, and unrolled three new and crisp
      bank-notes of ten dollars each.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think that's pretty good pay,&rdquo; he said, looking about him triumphantly.
      &ldquo;I don't care how many prizes Rathburn chooses to give his favorite. I
      rather think I can get along without them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John's face was turned toward the door, otherwise he would have observed
      the approach of the teacher, and spoken with more caution. But it was too
      late. The words had been spoken above his ordinary voice, and were
      distinctly heard by the teacher. He looked sharply at John Haynes, whose
      glance fell before his, but without a word passed into the schoolroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See if you don't get a blowing-up, John,&rdquo; said Dick Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do I care!&rdquo; said John, but in a tone too subdued to be heard by any
      one else. &ldquo;It won't do Rathburn any harm to hear the truth for once in his
      life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'm glad I'm not in your place, that's all!&rdquo; replied Dick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're easily frightened!&rdquo; rejoined John, with a sneer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, as he entered the schoolroom, and walked with assumed
      bravado to his seat in the back part of the room, he did not feel quite so
      comfortable as he strove to appear. As he glanced stealthily at the face
      of the teacher, who looked unusually stern and grave, he could not help
      thinking, &ldquo;I wonder whether he will say anything about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Rathburn commenced in the usual manner; but after the devotional
      exercises were over, he paused, and, after a brief silence, during which
      those who had heard John's words listened with earnest attention, spoke as
      follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I approached the schoolroom this morning I chanced to catch some words
      which I presume were not intended for my ear. If I remember rightly they
      were, 'I don't care how many prizes Rathburn gives his favorite!' There
      were several that heard them, so that I can be easily corrected if I have
      made any mistake. Now I will not affect to misunderstand the charge
      conveyed by these words. I am accused of assigning the prizes, or at
      least, one of them, yesterday, not with strict regard to the merit of the
      essays presented, but under the influence of partiality. If this is the
      real feeling of the speaker, I can only say that I am sorry he should have
      so low an opinion of me. I do not believe the scholars generally entertain
      any such suspicion. Though I may err in judgment, I think that most of you
      will not charge me with anything more serious. If you ask me whether a
      teacher has favorites, I say that he cannot help having them. He cannot
      help making a difference between the studious on the one hand, and the
      indolent and neglectful on the other. But in a matter like this I ask you
      to believe me when I say that no consideration except that of merit is
      permitted to weigh. The boy who made this charge is one of my most
      advanced scholars, and has no reason to believe that he would be treated
      with unfairness. I do not choose to say any more on this subject, except
      that I have decided to offer two similar prizes for the two best
      compositions submitted within the next four weeks. I shall assign them to
      the best of my judgment, without regard to the scholarship of the writer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Rathburn spoke in a quiet, dignified manner, which convinced all who
      heard him of his fairness. I say all, because even John Haynes was
      persuaded against his own will, though he did not choose to acknowledge
      it. He had a dogged obstinacy which would not allow him to retract what he
      had once said. There was an unpleasant sneer on his face while the teacher
      was speaking, which he did not attempt to conceal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The class in Virgil,&rdquo; called Mr. Rathburn.
    </p>
    <p>
      This class consisted of Frank Frost, John Haynes, and Henry Tufts. John
      rose slowly from his seat, and advanced to the usual place, taking care to
      stand as far from Frank as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may commence, John,&rdquo; said the teacher.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was unfortunate for John that he had been occupied, first, by thoughts
      of his rejected essay, and afterward by thoughts of the boat which he
      proposed to buy with the thirty dollars of which he had become possessed,
      so that he had found very little time to devote to his Latin. Had he been
      on good terms with Frank, he would have asked him to read over the lesson,
      which, as he was naturally quick, would have enabled him to get off
      passably. But, of course, under the circumstances, this was not to be
      thought of. So he stumbled through two or three sentences, in an
      embarrassed manner. Mr. Rathburn at first helped him along. Finding,
      however, that he knew little or nothing of the lesson, he quietly
      requested Frank to read, saying, &ldquo;You don't seem so well prepared as
      usual, John.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frank translated fluently and well, his recitation forming a very
      favorable contrast to the slipshod attempt of John. This John, in a spirit
      of unreasonableness, magnified into a grave offense, and a desire to &ldquo;show
      off&rdquo; at his expense.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trying to shine at my expense,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Well, let him! Two or three
      years hence, when I am in college, perhaps things may be a little
      different.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frank noticed his repellent look, and it made him feel uncomfortable. He
      was a warm-hearted boy, and wanted to be on good terms with everybody.
      Still, he could not help feeling that in the present instance he had
      nothing to reproach himself with.
    </p>
    <p>
      John went back to his seat feeling an increased irritation against Frank.
      He could not help seeing that he was more popular with his schoolmates
      than himself, and, of course, this, too, he considered a just cause of
      offense against him.
    </p>
    <p>
      While he was considering in what way he could slight Frank, the thought of
      the boat he was about to purchase entered his mind. He brightened up at
      once, for this suggested something. He knew how much boys like going out
      upon the water. At present there was no boat on the pond. His would hold
      six or eight boys readily. He would invite some of the oldest boys to
      accompany him on his first trip, carefully omitting Frank Frost. The
      slight would be still more pointed because Frank was his classmate.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the bell rang for recess he lost no time in carrying out the scheme
      he had thought of.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dick,&rdquo; he called out to Dick Jones, &ldquo;I am expecting my boat up from
      Boston next Tuesday, and I mean to go out in her Wednesday afternoon.
      Wouldn't you like to go with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With all the pleasure in life,&rdquo; said Dick, &ldquo;and thank you for the
      invitation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How many will she hold?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eight or ten, I expect. Bob Ingalls, would you like to go, too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The invitation was eagerly accepted. John next approached Henry Tufts, who
      was speaking with Frank Frost.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without even looking at the latter, he asked Henry if he would like to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very much,&rdquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I will expect you,&rdquo; he said. He turned on his heel and walked off
      without taking any notice of Frank.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank blushed in spite of himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't he mean to invite you?&rdquo; asked Henry, in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It appears not,&rdquo; said Frank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's mean in him, then,&rdquo; exclaimed Henry; &ldquo;I declare, I've a great mind
      not to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you will go,&rdquo; said Frank hastily. &ldquo;You will enjoy it. Promise me
      you will go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you really prefer to have me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should be very sorry if you didn't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I'll go; but I think he's mean in not asking you, for all that.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER VI. MR. FROST MAKES UP HIS MIND
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Frank,&rdquo; said his father at supper-time, &ldquo;I've been speaking to Mr.
      Maynard this afternoon about your plan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did he say?&rdquo; asked Frank, dropping his knife and fork in his
      eagerness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After he had thought a little, he spoke of it favorably. He said that,
      being too old to go himself, he should be glad to do anything in his power
      to facilitate my going, if I thought it my duty to do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't he think Frank rather young for such an undertaking?&rdquo; asked Mrs.
      Frost doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he did; but still he thought with proper advice and competent
      assistance he might get along. For the first, he can depend upon Mr.
      Maynard and myself; as for the second, Mr. Maynard suggested a good man,
      who is seeking a situation as farm laborer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it anybody in this town?&rdquo; asked Frank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it is a man from Brandon, named Jacob Carter. Mr. Maynard says he is
      honest, industrious, and used to working on a farm. I shall write to him
      this evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you have decided to go!&rdquo; exclaimed Frank and his mother in concert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will depend in part upon the answer I receive from this man Carter. I
      shall feel if he agrees to come, that I can go with less anxiety.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How we shall miss you!&rdquo; said his wife, in a subdued tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I shall miss you quite as much. It will be a considerable sacrifice
      for all of us. But when my country has need of me, you will feel that I
      cannot honorably stay at home. As for Frank, he may regard me as his
      substitute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My substitute!&rdquo; repeated Frank, in a questioning tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, since but for you, taking charge of the farm in my absence, I should
      not feel that I could go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frank looked pleased. It made him feel that he was really of some
      importance. Boys, unless they are incorrigibly idle, are glad to be placed
      in posts of responsibility. Frank, though very modest, felt within himself
      unused powers and undeveloped capacities, which he knew must be called out
      by the unusual circumstances in which he would be placed. The thought,
      too, that he would be serving his country, even at home, filled him with
      satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a pause, Mr. Frost said: &ldquo;There is one point on which I still have
      some doubts. As you are all equally interested with myself, I think it
      proper to ask your opinion, and shall abide by your decision.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frank and his mother listened with earnest attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are aware that the town has decided to give a bounty of one hundred
      and fifty dollars to such as may volunteer toward filling the quota. You
      may remember, also, that although the town passed the vote almost
      unanimously, it was my proposition, and supported by a speech of mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Squire Haynes opposed it, I think you said, father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and intimated that I urged the matter from interested motives. He
      said he presumed I intended to enlist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As if that sum would pay a man for leaving his home and incurring the
      terrible risks of war!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Frost, looking indignant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely he did not believe it himself; but he was irritated with me,
      and it is his habit to impute unworthy motives to those with whom he
      differs. Aside from this, however, I shall feel some delicacy in availing
      myself of a bounty which I was instrumental in persuading the town to
      vote. Though I feel that I should be perfectly justified in so doing, I
      confess that I am anxious not to put myself in such a position as to
      hazard any loss of good opinion on the part of my friends in town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then don't take it,&rdquo; said Mrs. Frost promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's what I say, too, father,&rdquo; chimed in Frank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't decide too hastily,&rdquo; said Mr. Frost. &ldquo;Remember that in our
      circumstances this amount of money would be very useful. Although Frank
      will do as well as any boy of his age, I do not expect him to make the
      farm as profitable as I should do, partly on account of my experience
      being greater, and partly because I should be able to accomplish more work
      than he. One hundred and fifty dollars would procure many little comforts
      which otherwise you may have to do without.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that,&rdquo; said Mrs. Frost quickly. &ldquo;But do you think I should enjoy
      them, if there were reports circulated, however unjustly, to your
      prejudice? Besides, I shall know that the comforts at the camp must be
      fewer than you would enjoy at home. We shall not wish to fare so much
      better than you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think with your mother, Frank?&rdquo; asked Mr. Frost.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think mother is right,&rdquo; said Frank, proud of having his opinion asked.
      He was secretly determined, in spite of what his father had said, to see
      if he could not make the farm as profitable as it would be under his
      father's management.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Frost seemed relieved by his wife's expression of opinion. &ldquo;Then,&rdquo;
       said he, &ldquo;I will accept your decision as final. I felt that it should be
      you, and not myself, who should decide it. Now my mind will be at ease, so
      far as that goes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will not enlist at once, father?&rdquo; asked Frank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not for three or four weeks. I shall wish to give you some special
      instructions before I go, so that your task may be easier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hadn't I better leave school at once?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may finish this week out. However, I may as well begin my
      instructions without delay. I believe you have never learned to milk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably Carter will undertake that. Still, it will be desirable that you
      should know how, in case he gets sick. You may come out with me after
      supper and take your first lesson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frank ran for his hat with alacrity. This seemed like beginning in
      earnest. He accompanied his father to the barn, and looked with new
      interest at the four cows constituting his father's stock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think we will begin with this one,&rdquo; said his father, pointing to a
      red-and-white heifer. &ldquo;She is better-natured than the others, and, as I
      dare say your fingers will bungle a little at first, that is a point to be
      considered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If any of my boy readers has ever undertaken the task of milking for the
      first time, he will appreciate Frank's difficulties. When he had seen his
      father milking, it seemed to him extremely easy. The milk poured out in
      rich streams, almost without an effort. But under his inexperienced
      fingers none came. He tugged away manfully, but with no result.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess the cow's dry,&rdquo; said he at last, looking up in his father's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Frost in reply drew out a copious stream.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did the same as you,&rdquo; said Frank, mystified, &ldquo;and none came.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn't take hold right,&rdquo; said his father, &ldquo;and you pressed at the
      wrong time. Let me show you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before the first lesson was over Frank had advanced a little in the art of
      milking, and it may as well be said here that in the course of a week or
      so he became a fair proficient, so that his father even allowed him to try
      Vixen, a cow who had received this name from the uncertainty of her
      temper. She had more than once upset the pail with a spiteful kick when it
      was nearly full. One morning she upset not only the pail, but Frank, who
      looked foolish enough as he got up covered with milk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank also commenced reading the Plowman, a weekly agricultural paper
      which his father had taken for years. Until now he had confined his
      readings in it to the selected story on the fourth page. Now, with an
      object in view, he read carefully other parts of the paper. He did this
      not merely in the first flush of enthusiasm, but with the steady purpose
      of qualifying himself to take his father's place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frank is an uncommon boy,&rdquo; said Mr. Frost to his wife, not without
      feelings of pride, one night, when our hero had retired to bed. &ldquo;I would
      trust him with the farm sooner than many who are half a dozen years
      older.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII. LIKE FATHER, LIKE SON
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, father, I've got some news for you,&rdquo; said John Haynes, as he
      entered his father's presence, two or three days later.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, John?&rdquo; inquired the squire, laying down a copy of the New
      York Herald, which he had been reading.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who do you think has enlisted?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not choose to guess,&rdquo; said his father coldly. &ldquo;If you feel disposed
      to tell me, you may do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John looked somewhat offended at his father's tone, but he was anxious to
      tell the news. &ldquo;Frost's going to enlist,&rdquo; he said shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; said the squire, with interest. &ldquo;How did you hear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard him say so himself, just now, in the store.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expected it,&rdquo; said Squire Haynes, with a sneer. &ldquo;I understood his
      motives perfectly in urging the town to pay an enormous bounty to
      volunteers. He meant to line his own pockets at the public expense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He says that he doesn't mean to accept the bounty,&rdquo; continued John, in a
      tone which indicated a doubt whether Mr. Frost was in earnest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you hear him say that?&rdquo; asked Squire Haynes abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I heard him say so to Mr. Morse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps he means it, and perhaps he doesn't. If he don't take it, it is
      because he is afraid of public opinion. What's he going to do about the
      farm, while he is gone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the strangest part of it,&rdquo; said John. &ldquo;I don't believe you could
      guess who is to be left in charge of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't choose to guess. If you know, speak out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John bit his lip resentfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's that conceited jackanapes of his&mdash;Frank Frost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean that he is going to leave that boy to carry on the farm?&rdquo;
       demanded Squire Haynes, in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, all I can say is that he's more of a fool than I took him to be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he thinks everything of Frank,&rdquo; said John bitterly. &ldquo;He'll be
      nominating him for representative next.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The squire winced a little. He had been ambitious to represent the town in
      the legislature, and after considerable wire-pulling had succeeded in
      obtaining the nomination the year previous. But it is one thing to be
      nominated and another to be elected. So the squire had found, to his cost.
      He had barely obtained fifty votes, while his opponent had been elected by
      a vote of a hundred and fifty. All allusions, therefore, recalling his
      mortifying defeat were disagreeable to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the whole, I don't know but I'm satisfied,&rdquo; he said, recurring to the
      intelligence John had brought. &ldquo;So far as I am concerned, I am glad he has
      made choice of this boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't think he is competent?&rdquo; asked John, in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For that very reason I am glad he has been selected,&rdquo; said the squire
      emphatically. &ldquo;I take it for granted that the farm will be mismanaged, and
      become a bill of expense, instead of a source of revenue. It's pretty
      certain that Frost won't be able to pay the mortgage when it comes due. I
      can bid off the farm for a small sum additional and make a capital
      bargain. It will make a very good place for you to settle down upon,
      John.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me!&rdquo; said John disdainfully. &ldquo;You don't expect me to become a plodding
      farmer, I trust. I've got talent for something better than that, I should
      hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the squire, &ldquo;I have other news for you. Still, you could hire a
      farmer to carry it on for you, and live out there in the summer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, perhaps that would do,&rdquo; said John, thinking that it would sound
      well for him, even if he lived in the city, to have a place in the
      country. &ldquo;When does the mortgage come due, father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't remember the exact date. I'll look and see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The squire drew from a closet a box hooped with iron, and evidently made
      for security. This was his strong-box, and in this he kept his bonds,
      mortgages, and other securities.
    </p>
    <p>
      He selected a document tied with red ribbon, and examined it briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall have the right to foreclose the mortgage on the first of next
      July,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you will do it then. I should like to see them Frosts humbled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;THEM Frosts! Don't you know anything more about English grammar, John?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those Frosts, then. Of course, I know; but a feller can't always be
      watching his words.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I desire you never again to use the low word 'feller,'&rdquo; said the squire,
      who, as the reader will see, was more particular about grammatical
      accuracy than about some other things which might be naturally supposed to
      be of higher importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said John sulkily, &ldquo;anything you choose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As to the mortgage,&rdquo; proceeded Squire Haynes, &ldquo;I have no idea they will
      be able to lift it. I feel certain that Frost won't himself have the money
      at command, and I sha'n't give him any grace, or consent to a renewal. He
      may be pretty sure of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps he'll find somebody to lend him the money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think not. There are those who would be willing, but I question whether
      there is any such who could raise the money at a moment's warning. By the
      way, you need not mention my purpose in this matter to any one. If it
      should leak out, Mr. Frost might hear of it, and prepare for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may trust me for that, father,&rdquo; said John, very decidedly; &ldquo;I want to
      see Frank Frost's proud spirit humbled. Perhaps he'll feel like putting on
      airs after that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From the conversation which has just been chronicled it will be perceived
      that John was a worthy son of his father; and, though wanting in affection
      and cordial good feeling, that both were prepared to join hands in
      devising mischief to poor Frank and his family. Let us hope that the
      intentions of the wicked may be frustrated.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII. DISCOURAGED AND ENCOURAGED
    </h2>
    <p>
      In a small village like Rossville news flies fast. Even the distinctions
      of social life do not hinder an interest being felt in the affairs of each
      individual. Hence it was that Mr. Frost's determination to enlist became
      speedily known, and various were the comments made upon his plan of
      leaving Frank in charge of the farm. That they were not all favorable may
      be readily believed. Country people are apt to criticize the proceedings
      of their neighbors with a greater degree of freedom than is common
      elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Frank was on his way to school on Saturday morning, his name was called
      by Mrs. Roxana Mason, who stood in the doorway of a small yellow house
      fronting on the main street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning, Mrs. Mason,&rdquo; said Frank politely, advancing to the gate in
      answer to her call.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it true what I've heard about your father's going to the war, Frank
      Frost?&rdquo; she commenced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Mrs. Mason; he feels it his duty to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what's to become of the farm? Anybody hired it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to take charge of it,&rdquo; said Frank modestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Roxana, lifting both hands in amazement; &ldquo;why,
      you're nothing but a baby!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm a baby of fifteen,&rdquo; said Frank good-humoredly, though his courage was
      a little dampened by her tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you know about farming?&rdquo; inquired the lady, in a contemptuous
      manner. &ldquo;Your father must be crazy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall do my best, Mrs. Mason,&rdquo; said Frank quietly, but with heightened
      color. &ldquo;My father is willing to trust me; and as I shall have Mr. Maynard
      to look to for advice, I think I can get along.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The idea of putting a boy like you over a farm!&rdquo; returned Mrs. Roxana, in
      an uncompromising tone. &ldquo;I did think your father had more sense. It's the
      most shiftless thing I ever knew him to do. How does your poor mother feel
      about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She doesn't seem as much disturbed about it as you do, Mrs. Mason,&rdquo; said
      Frank, rather impatiently; for he felt that Mrs. Mason had no right to
      interfere in his father's arrangements.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, we'll see!&rdquo; said Mrs. Roxana, shaking her head significantly.
      &ldquo;If you'll look in your Bible, you'll read about 'the haughty spirit that
      goes before a fall.' I'm sure I wish you well enough. I hope that
      things'll turn out better'n they're like to. Tell your mother I'll come
      over before long and talk with her about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frank inwardly hoped that Mrs. Roxana wouldn't put herself to any trouble
      to call, but politeness taught him to be silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving Mrs. Mason's gate, he kept on his way to school, but had hardly
      gone half a dozen rods before he met an old lady, whose benevolent face
      indicated a very different disposition from that of the lady he had just
      parted with.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning, Mrs. Chester,&rdquo; said Frank cordially, recognizing one of his
      mother's oldest friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning, my dear boy,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;I hear your father is going
      to the war.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Frank, a little nervously, not knowing but Mrs. Chester would
      view the matter in the same way as Mrs. Mason, though he felt sure she
      would express herself less disagreeably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I hear that you are going to try to make his place good at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't expect to make his place good, Mrs. Chester,&rdquo; said Frank
      modestly, &ldquo;but I shall do as well as I can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no doubt of it, my dear boy,&rdquo; said the old lady kindly. &ldquo;You can
      do a great deal, too. You can help your mother by looking out for your
      brothers and sisters, as well as supplying your father's place on the
      farm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad you think I can make myself useful,&rdquo; said Frank, feeling
      relieved. &ldquo;Mrs. Mason has just been telling me that I am not fit for the
      charge, and that discouraged me a little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a great responsibility, no doubt, to come on one so young,&rdquo; said the
      old lady, &ldquo;but it's of God's appointment. He will strengthen your hands,
      if you will only ask Him. If you humbly seek His guidance and assistance,
      you need not fear to fail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Frank soberly, &ldquo;that's what I mean to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you will feel that you are in the path of duty. You'll be serving
      your country just as much as if you went yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's just the way I feel, Mrs. Chester,&rdquo; exclaimed Frank eagerly. &ldquo;I
      want to do something for my country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You remind me of my oldest brother,&rdquo; said the old lady thoughtfully. &ldquo;He
      was left pretty much as you are. It was about the middle of the
      Revolutionary war, and the army needed recruits. My father hesitated, for
      he had a small family depending on him for support. I was only two years
      old at the time, and there were three of us. Finally my brother James, who
      was just about your age, told my father that he would do all he could to
      support the family, and father concluded to go. We didn't have a farm, for
      father was a carpenter. My brother worked for neighboring farmers,
      receiving his pay in corn and vegetables, and picked up what odd jobs he
      could. Then mother was able to do something; so we managed after a
      fashion. There were times when we were brought pretty close to the wall,
      but God carried us through. And by and by father came safely home, and I
      don't think he ever regretted having left us. After awhile the good news
      of peace came, and he felt that he had been abundantly repaid for all the
      sacrifices he had made in the good cause.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frank listened to this narrative with great interest. It yielded him no
      little encouragement to know that another boy, placed in similar
      circumstances, had succeeded, and he just felt that he would have very
      much less to contend against than the brother of whom Mrs. Chester spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you for telling me about your brother Mrs. Chester,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It
      makes me feel more as if things would turn out well. Won't you come over
      soon and see us? Mother is always glad to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Frank; I shall certainly do so. I hope I shall not make you
      late to school.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no; I started half an hour early this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frank had hardly left Mrs. Chester when he heard a quick step behind him.
      Turning round, he perceived that it was Mr. Rathburn, his teacher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hurried to come up with you, Frank,&rdquo; he said, smiling. &ldquo;I understand
      that I am to lose you from school.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; answered Frank. &ldquo;I am very sorry to leave, for I am very much
      interested in my studies; but I suppose, sir, you have heard what calls me
      away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your father has made up his mind to enlist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you are to superintend the farm in his absence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir. I hope you do not think me presumptuous in undertaking such a
      responsibility?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked up eagerly into Mr. Rathburn's face, for he had a great respect
      for his judgment. But he saw nothing to discourage him. On the contrary,
      he read cordial sympathy and approval.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Far from it,&rdquo; answered the teacher, with emphasis. &ldquo;I think you deserving
      of great commendation, especially if, as I have heard, the plan originated
      with you, and was by you suggested to your father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The teacher held out his hand kindly. &ldquo;It was only what I should have
      expected of you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have not forgotten your essay. I am glad to
      see that you not only have right ideas of duty, but have, what is rarer,
      the courage and self-denial to put them in practice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These words gave Frank much pleasure, and his face lighted up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall you feel obliged to give up your studies entirely?&rdquo; asked his
      teacher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I shall be able to study some in the evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I can be of any assistance to you in any way, don't hesitate to apply.
      If you should find any stumbling-blocks in your lessons, I may be able to
      help you over them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By this time they had come within sight of the schoolhouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There comes the young farmer,&rdquo; said John Haynes, in a tone which was only
      subdued lest the teacher should hear him, for he had no disposition to
      incur another public rebuke.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few minutes later, when Frank was quietly seated at his desk, a paper
      was thrown from behind, lighting upon his Virgil, which lay open before
      him. There appeared to be writing upon it, and with some curiosity he
      opened and read the following:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the price of turnips?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was quite unnecessary to inquire into the authorship. He felt confident
      it was written by John Haynes. The latter, of course, intended it as an
      insult, but Frank did not feel much disturbed. As long as his conduct was
      approved by such persons as his teacher and Mrs. Chester, he felt he could
      safely disregard the taunts and criticisms of others. He therefore quietly
      let the paper drop to the floor, and kept on with his lesson.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Haynes perceived that he had failed in his benevolent purpose of
      disturbing Frank's tranquillity, and this, I am sorry to say, only
      increased the dislike he felt for him. Nothing is so unreasonable as
      anger, nothing so hard to appease. John even felt disposed to regard as an
      insult the disposition which Frank had made of his insulting query.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The young clodhopper's on his dignity,&rdquo; he muttered to himself. &ldquo;Well,
      wait a few months, and see if he won't sing a different tune.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just then John's class was called up, and his dislike to Frank was not
      diminished by the superiority of his recitation. The latter, undisturbed
      by John's feelings, did not give a thought to him, but reflected with a
      touch of pain that this must be his last Latin recitation in school for a
      long time to come.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX. THE LAST EVENING AT HOME
    </h2>
    <p>
      Three weeks passed quickly. October had already reached its middle point.
      The glory of the Indian summer was close at hand. Too quickly the days
      fled for the little family at the farm, for they knew that each brought
      nearer the parting of which they could not bear to think.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jacob Carter, who had been sent for to do the heavy work on the farm, had
      arrived. He was a man of forty, stout and able to work, but had enjoyed
      few opportunities of cultivating his mind. Though a faithful laborer, he
      was destitute of the energy and ambition which might ere this have placed
      him in charge of a farm of his own. In New England few arrive at his age
      without achieving some position more desirable and independent than that
      of farm laborer. However, he looked pleasant and good-natured, and Mr.
      Frost accounted himself fortunate in securing his services.
    </p>
    <p>
      The harvest had been got in, and during the winter months there would not
      be so much to do as before. Jacob, therefore, &ldquo;hired out&rdquo; for a smaller
      compensation, to be increased when the spring work came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank had not been idle. He had accompanied his father about the farm, and
      received as much practical instruction in the art of farming as the time
      would admit. He was naturally a quick learner, and now felt impelled by a
      double motive to prepare himself as well as possible to assume his new
      responsibilities. His first motive was, of course, to make up his father's
      loss to the family, as far as it was possible for him to do so, but he was
      also desirous of showing Mrs. Roxana Mason and other ill-boding prophets
      that they had underrated his abilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      The time came when Mr. Frost felt that he must leave his family. He had
      enlisted from preference in an old regiment, already in Virginia, some
      members of which had gone from Rossville. A number of recruits were to be
      forwarded to the camp on a certain day, and that day was now close at
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let me introduce the reader to the farmhouse on the last evening for many
      months when they would be able to be together. They were all assembled
      about the fireplace. Mr. Frost sat in an armchair, holding Charlie in his
      lap&mdash;the privileged place of the youngest. Alice, with the air of a
      young woman, sat demurely by her father's side on a cricket, while Maggie
      stood beside him, with one hand resting on his knee. Frank sat quietly
      beside his mother, as if already occupying the place which he was in
      future to hold as her counselor and protector.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank and his mother looked sober. They had not realized fully until this
      evening what it would be to part with the husband and father&mdash;how
      constantly they would miss him at the family meal and in the evening
      circle. Then there was the dreadful uncertainty of war. He might never
      return, or, if spared for that, it might be with broken constitution or
      the loss of a limb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it hadn't been for me,&rdquo; Frank could not help thinking, &ldquo;father would
      not now be going away. He would have stayed at home, and I could still go
      to school. It would have made a great difference to us, and the loss of
      one man could not affect the general result.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A moment after his conscience rebuked him for harboring so selfish a
      thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The country needs him more even than we do,&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;It will
      be a hard trial to have him go, but it is our duty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will my little Charlie miss me when I am gone?&rdquo; asked Mr. Frost of the
      chubby-faced boy who sat with great, round eyes peering into the fire, as
      if he were deeply engaged in thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won't you take me with you, papa?&rdquo; asked Charlie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What could you do if you were out there, my little boy?&rdquo; asked the
      father, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd shoot great big rebel with my gun,&rdquo; said Charlie, waxing valiant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your gun's only a wooden one,&rdquo; said Maggie, with an air of superior
      knowledge. &ldquo;You couldn't kill a rebel with that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd kill 'em some,&rdquo; persisted Charlie earnestly, evidently believing that
      a wooden gun differed from others not in kind, but in degree.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But suppose the rebels should fire at you,&rdquo; said Frank, amused. &ldquo;What
      would you do then, Charlie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Charlie looked into the fire thoughtfully for a moment, as if this
      contingency had not presented itself to his mind until now. Suddenly his
      face brightened up, and he answered. &ldquo;I'd run away just as fast as I
      could.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All laughed at this, and Frank said: &ldquo;But that wouldn't be acting like a
      brave soldier, Charlie. You ought to stay and make the enemy run.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn't want to stay and be shooted,&rdquo; said Charlie ingenuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are many older than Charlie,&rdquo; said Mr. Frost, smiling, &ldquo;who would
      doubtless sympathize entirely with him in his objection to being shooted,
      though they might not be quite so ready to make confession as he has shown
      himself. I suppose you have heard the couplet:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &ldquo;'He who fights and runs away
               May live to fight another day.'&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray don't speak about shooting,&rdquo; said Mrs. Frost, with a shudder. &ldquo;It
      makes me feel nervous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And to-night we should only admit pleasant thoughts,&rdquo; said her husband.
      &ldquo;Who is going to write me letters when I am gone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll write to you, father,&rdquo; said Alice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so will I,&rdquo; said Maggie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, too,&rdquo; chimed in Charlie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, if you have so many correspondents already engaged, you will hardly
      want to hear from Frank and myself,&rdquo; said his wife, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The more the better. I suspect I shall find letters more welcome than
      anything else. You must also send me papers regularly. I shall have many
      hours that will pass heavily unless I have something to read.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll mail you Harper's Weekly regularly, shall I, father?&rdquo; asked Frank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I shall be glad enough to see it. Then, there is one good thing
      about papers&mdash;after enjoying them myself, I can pass them round to
      others. There are many privations that I must make up my mind to, but I
      shall endeavor to make camp-life as pleasant as possible to myself and
      others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you were going out as an officer,&rdquo; said Mrs. Frost. &ldquo;You would
      have more indulgences.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very probably I should. But I don't feel inclined to wish myself better
      off than others. I am: willing to serve my country in any capacity in
      which I can be of use. Thank Heaven, I am pretty strong and healthy, and
      better fitted than many to encounter the fatigues and exposures which are
      the lot of the private.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How early must you start to-morrow, father?&rdquo; inquired Frank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By daylight. I must be in Boston by nine o'clock, and you know it is a
      five-mile ride to the depot. I shall want you to carry me over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will there be room for me?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Frost. &ldquo;I want to see the last of
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you won't do that for a long time to come,&rdquo; said Mr. Frost,
      smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know what I mean, Henry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, there will be room. At any rate, we will make room for you. And
      now it seems to me it is time for these little folks to go to bed. Charlie
      finds it hard work to keep his eyes open.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, papa, papa, not yet, not yet,&rdquo; pleaded the children; and with the
      thought that it might be many a long day before he saw their sweet young
      faces again, the father suffered them to have their way.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the children had gone to bed Frank and his father and mother sat up
      for a long time. Each felt that there was much to be said, but no one of
      them felt like saying much then. Thoughts of the approaching separation
      swallowed up all others. The thought kept recurring that to-morrow would
      see them many miles apart, and that many a long to-morrow must pass before
      they would again be gathered around the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frank,&rdquo; said his father, at length, &ldquo;I have deposited in the Brandon Bank
      four hundred dollars, about half of which I have realized from crops sold
      this season. This you will draw upon as you have need, for grocery bills,
      to pay Jacob, etc. For present purposes I will hand you fifty dollars,
      which I advise you to put under your mother's care.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he finished speaking, Mr. Frost drew from his pocketbook a roll of
      bills and handed them to Frank.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank opened his portemonnaie and deposited the money therein.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had never before so large a sum of money in his possession, and
      although he knew it was not to be spent for his own benefit&mdash;at
      least, no considerable part of it&mdash;he felt a sense of importance and
      even wealth in being the custodian of so much money. He felt that his
      father had confidence in him, and that he was in truth going to be his
      representative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A part of the money which I have in the bank,&rdquo; continued his father, &ldquo;has
      been saved up toward the payment of the mortgage on the farm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When does it come due, father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the first of July of next year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you won't be prepared to meet it at that time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but undoubtedly Squire Haynes will be willing to renew it. I always
      pay the interest promptly, and he knows it is secured by the farm, and
      therefore a safe investment. By the way, I had nearly forgotten to say
      that there will be some interest due on the first of January. Of course,
      you are authorized to pay it just as if you were myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much will it be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty-four dollars&mdash;that is, six months' interest at six per cent.
      on eight hundred dollars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish the farm were free from encumbrance,&rdquo; said Frank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So do I; and if Providence favors me it shall be before many years are
      past. But in farming one can't expect to lay by money quite as fast as in
      some other employments.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old clock in the corner here struck eleven.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We mustn't keep you up too late the last night, Henry,&rdquo; said Mrs. Frost.
      &ldquo;You will need a good night's sleep to carry you through to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Neither of the three closed their eyes early that night. Thoughts of the
      morrow were naturally in their minds. At last all was still. Sleep&mdash;God's
      beneficent messenger&mdash;wrapped their senses in oblivion, and the cares
      and anxieties of the morrow were for a time forgotten.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X. LITTLE POMP
    </h2>
    <h3>
      There was a hurried good-by at the depot.
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kiss the children for me, Mary,&rdquo; said her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will write very soon?&rdquo; pleaded Mrs. Frost.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the very first opportunity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All aboard!&rdquo; shouted the conductor.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a shrill scream the locomotive started.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank and his mother stood on the platform watching the receding train
      till it was quite out of sight, and then in silence our young hero
      assisted his mother into the carryall and turned the horse's head
      homeward.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was one of those quiet October mornings, when the air is soft and balmy
      as if a June day had found its way by mistake into the heart of autumn.
      The road wound partly through the woods. The leaves were still green and
      abundant. Only one or two showed signs of the coming change, which in the
      course of a few weeks must leave them bare and leafless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a beautiful day!&rdquo; said Frank, speaking the words almost
      unconsciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beautiful indeed!&rdquo; responded his mother. &ldquo;On such a day as this the world
      seems too lovely for war and warlike passions to be permitted to enter it.
      When men might be so happy, why need they stain their hands with each
      other's blood?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frank was unprepared for an answer. He knew that it was his father's
      departure which led his mother to speak thus. He wished to divert her
      mind, if possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Circumstances favored his design.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had accomplished perhaps three-quarters of the distance home when, as
      they were passing a small one-story building by the roadside, a shriek of
      pain was heard, and a little black boy came running out of the house,
      screaming in affright: &ldquo;Mammy's done killed herself. She's mos' dead!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He ran out to the road and looked up at Mrs. Frost, as if to implore
      assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's Chloe's child,&rdquo; said Mrs. Frost. &ldquo;Stop the horse, Frank; I'll get
      out and see what has happened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chloe, as Frank very well knew, was a colored woman, who until a few
      months since had been a slave in Virginia. Finally she had seized a
      favorable opportunity, and taking the only child which the cruel slave
      system had left her, for the rest had been sold South, succeeded in making
      her way into Pennsylvania. Chance had directed her to Rossville, where she
      had been permitted to occupy, rent free, an old shanty which for some
      years previous had been uninhabited. Here she had supported herself by
      taking in washing and ironing. This had been her special work on the
      plantation where she had been born and brought up, and she was therefore
      quite proficient in it. She found no difficulty in obtaining work enough
      to satisfy the moderate wants of herself and little Pomp.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter was a bright little fellow, as black as the ace of spades, and
      possessing to the full the mercurial temperament of the Southern negro.
      Full of fun and drollery, he attracted plenty of attention when he came
      into the village, and earned many a penny from the boys by his plantation
      songs and dances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, however, he appeared in a mood entirely different, and it was easy to
      see that he was much frightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter, Pomp?&rdquo; asked Frank, as he brought his horse to a
      standstill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mammy done killed herself,&rdquo; he repeated, wringing his hands in terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      A moan from the interior of the house seemed to make it clear that
      something had happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Frost pushed the door open and entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chloe had sunk down on the floor and was rocking back and forth, holding
      her right foot in both hands, with an expression of acute pain on her
      sable face. Beside her was a small pail, bottom upward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Frost was at no loss to conjecture the nature of the accident which
      had befallen her. The pail had contained hot water, and its accidental
      overturn had scalded poor Chloe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you much hurt, Chloe?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Frost sympathizingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, missus, I's most dead,&rdquo; was the reply, accompanied by a groan.
      &ldquo;'Spect I sha'n't live till mornin'. Dunno what'll become of poor Pomp
      when I'se gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Little Pomp squeezed his knuckles into his eyes and responded with an
      unearthly howl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be too much frightened, Chloe,&rdquo; said Mrs. Frost soothingly. &ldquo;You'll
      get over it sooner than you think. How did the pail happen to turn over?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Must have been de debbel, missus. I was kerryin' it just as keerful, when
      all at once it upsot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This explanation, though not very luminous to her visitor, appeared to
      excite a fierce spirit of resentment against the pail in the mind of
      little Pomp.
    </p>
    <p>
      He suddenly rushed forward impetuously and kicked the pail with all the
      force he could muster.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, alas for poor Pomp! His feet were unprotected by shoes, and the
      sudden blow hurt him much more than the pail. The consequence was a howl
      of the most distressing nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank had started forward to rescue Pomp from the consequences of his
      precipitancy, but too late. He picked up the little fellow and, carrying
      him out, strove to soothe him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Mrs. Frost examined Chloe's injuries. They were not so great as
      she had anticipated. She learned on inquiry that the water had not been
      scalding hot. There was little doubt that with proper care she would
      recover from her injuries in a week or ten days. But in the meantime it
      would not do to use the foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shall I do, missus?&rdquo; groaned Chloe. &ldquo;I ain't got nothin' baked up.
      'Pears like me and Pomp must starve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so bad as that, Chloe,&rdquo; said Mrs. Frost, with a reassuring smile.
      &ldquo;After we have you on the bed we will take Pomp home with us, and give him
      enough food to last you both a couple of days. At the end of that time, or
      sooner, if you get out, you can send him up again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chloe expressed her gratitude warmly, and Mrs. Frost, calling in Frank's
      assistance, helped the poor woman to a comfortable position on the bed,
      which fortunately was in the corner of the same room. Had it been
      upstairs, the removal would have been attended with considerable
      difficulty as well as pain to Chloe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pomp, the acuteness of whose pain had subsided, looked on with wondering
      eyes while Frank and Mrs. Frost &ldquo;toted&rdquo; his mother onto the bed, as he
      expressed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chloe accepted, with wondering gratitude, the personal attentions of Mrs.
      Frost, who bound up the injured foot with a softness of touch which
      brought no pain to the sufferer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ain't too proud, missus, to tend to a poor black woman,&rdquo; she said.
      &ldquo;Down Souf dey used to tell us dat everybody looked down on de poor nigger
      and lef' 'em to starve an' die if dey grow sick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They told you a great many things that were not true, Chloe,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Frost quietly. &ldquo;The color of the skin ought to make no difference where we
      have it in our power to render kind offices.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you believe niggers go to de same heaven wid w'ite folks, missus?&rdquo;
       asked Chloe, after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should they not? They were made by the same God.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dunno, missus,&rdquo; said Chloe. &ldquo;I hopes you is right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think you can spare Pomp a little while to go home with us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, missus. Here you, Pomp,&rdquo; she called, &ldquo;you go home wid dis good lady,
      and she'll gib you something for your poor sick mudder. Do you hear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'se goin' to ride?&rdquo; said Pomp inquiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Frank good-naturedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hi, hi, dat's prime!&rdquo; ejaculated Pomp, turning a somersault in his joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Scramble in, then, and we'll start.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pomp needed no second invitation. He jumped into the carriage, and was
      more leisurely followed by Frank and his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was probably the first time that Pomp had ever been in a covered
      carriage, and consequently the novelty of his situation put him in high
      spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was anxious to drive, and Frank, to gratify him, placed the reins in
      his hands. His eyes sparkling with delight, and his expanded mouth showing
      a full set of ivories, Pomp shook the reins in glee, shouting out, &ldquo;Hi, go
      along there, you ol' debble!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pomp, you mustn't use that word,&rdquo; said Mrs. Frost reprovingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What word, missus?&rdquo; demanded Pomp innocently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The last word you used,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't 'member what word you mean, missus,&rdquo; said Pomp. &ldquo;Hi, you debble!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the word?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not say 'debble'?&rdquo; said Pomp wonderingly. &ldquo;Why not, missus?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn't a good word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mammy says 'debble.' She calls me little debble when I run away, and
      don't tote in de wood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall tell her not to use it. It isn't a good word for anybody to use.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hope you'll tell her so, missus,&rdquo; said Pomp, grinning and showing his
      teeth. &ldquo;Wheneber she calls me little debble she pulls off her shoe and
      hits me. Hurts like de debble. Mebbe she won't hit me if you tell her not
      to say 'debble.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Frost could hardly forbear laughing. She managed, however, to
      preserve a serious countenance while she said, &ldquo;You must take care to
      behave well, and then she won't have to punish you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is somewhat doubtful whether Pomp heard this last remark. He espied a
      pig walking by the side of the road, and was seized with a desire to run
      over it. Giving the reins a sudden twitch, he brought the carriage round
      so that it was very near upsetting in a gully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank snatched the reins in time to prevent this catastrophe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you do that for, Pomp?&rdquo; he said quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wanted to scare de pig,&rdquo; exclaimed Pomp, laughing. &ldquo;Wanted to hear him
      squeal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so you nearly tipped us over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't mean to do dat, Mass' Frank. 'Pears like I didn't think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Frost was too much alarmed by this narrow escape to consent to Pomp's
      driving again, and for the moment felt as if she should like to usurp his
      mother's privilege of spanking him. But the little imp looked so
      unconscious of having done anything wrong that her vexation soon passed
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      In half an hour Pomp was on his way back, laden with a basketful of
      provisions for his sick mother and himself.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI. PUNISHING A BULLY
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was fortunate for Mrs. Frost that she was so soon called upon to think
      for others. It gave her less time to grieve over her husband's absence,
      which was naturally a severe trial to her. As for Frank, though the
      harvest was gathered in, there were plenty of small jobs to occupy his
      attention. He divided with Jacob the care of the cows, and was up betimes
      in the morning to do his share of the milking. Then the pigs and chickens
      must be fed every day, and this Frank took entirely into his own charge.
      Wood, also, must be prepared for the daily wants of the house, and this
      labor he shared with Jacob.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the afternoon, however, Frank usually had two or three hours at his own
      disposal, and this, in accordance with a previous determination, he
      resolved to devote to keeping up his studies. He did not expect to make
      the same progress that he would have done if he had been able to continue
      at school, but it was something to feel that he was not remaining
      stationary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank resolved to say nothing to his classmates about his private studies.
      They would think he was falling far behind, and at some future time he
      would surprise them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, there were times when he felt the need of a teacher. He would
      occasionally encounter difficulties which he found himself unable to
      surmount without assistance. At such times he thought of Mr Rathburn's
      kind offer. But his old teacher lived nearly a mile distant, and he felt
      averse to troubling him, knowing that his duties in school were arduous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Occasionally he met some of his schoolmates. As nearly all of them were
      friendly and well-disposed to him, this gave him pleasure, and brought
      back sometimes the wish that he was as free as they. But this wish was
      almost instantly checked by the thought that he had made a sacrifice for
      his country's sake.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days after the incident narrated in the last chapter, Frank was out
      in the woods not far from Chloe's cottage, collecting brushwood, to be
      afterward carried home, when his attention was called to an altercation,
      one of the parties in which he readily recognized as little Pomp. To
      explain how it came about, we shall have to go back a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pomp was returning from Mrs. Frost's, swinging a tin kettle containing
      provisions for his mother and himself, when all at once he met John
      Haynes, who was coming from the opposite direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, John was something of a bully, and liked to exercise authority over
      the boys who were small enough to render the attempt a safe one. On the
      present occasion he felt in a hectoring mood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll have some fun out of the little nigger,&rdquo; he said to himself, as he
      espied Pomp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pomp approached, swinging his pail as before, and whistling a plantation
      melody.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you got there, Pomp?&rdquo; asked John.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'se got a pail,&rdquo; said Pomp independently. &ldquo;Don't yer know a pail when
      you see him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know an impudent little nigger when I see him,&rdquo; retorted John, not
      overpleased with the answer. &ldquo;Come here directly, and let me see what
      you've got in your pail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain't got noffin for you,&rdquo; said Pomp defiantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll see about that,&rdquo; said John. &ldquo;Now, do you mean to come here or not?
      I'm going to count three, and I'll give you that time to decide. One&mdash;two&mdash;three!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pomp apparently had no intention of complying with John's request. He had
      halted about three rods from him, and stood swinging his pail, meanwhile
      watching John warily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see you want me to come after you,&rdquo; said John angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      He ran toward Pomp, but the little contraband dodged him adroitly, and got
      on the other side of a tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      Opposition only stimulated John to new efforts. He had become excited in
      the pursuit, and had made up his mind to capture Pomp, who dodged in and
      out among the trees with such quickness and dexterity that John was foiled
      for a considerable time. The ardor of his pursuit and its unexpected
      difficulty excited his anger. He lost sight of the fact that Pomp was
      under no obligation to comply with his demand. But this is generally the
      way with tyrants, who are seldom careful to keep within the bounds of
      justice and reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just let me catch you, you little rascal, and I will give you the worst
      licking you ever had,&rdquo; John exclaimed, with passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait till you catch me,&rdquo; returned Pomp, slipping, eel-like, from his
      grasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Pomp, in dodging, had now come to an open space, where he was at a
      disadvantage. John was close upon him, when suddenly he stood stock-still,
      bending his back so as to obtain a firm footing. The consequence was that
      his too ardent pursuer tumbled over him, and stretched his length upon the
      ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately for Pomp, John grasped his leg in falling, and held it by so
      firm a grip that he was unable to get free. In the moment of his downfall
      John attained his object.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I've got you,&rdquo; he said, white with passion, &ldquo;and I'm going to teach
      you a lesson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clinging to Pomp with one hand, he drew a stout string from his pocket
      with the other, and secured the hands of the little contraband,
      notwithstanding his efforts to escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Le' me go, you debble,&rdquo; he said, using a word which had grown familiar to
      him on the plantation.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a cruel light in John's eyes which augured little good to poor
      Pomp. Suddenly, as if a new idea had struck him, he loosened the cord, and
      taking the boy carried him, in spite of his kicking and screaming, to a
      small tree, around which he clasped his hands, which he again confined
      with cords.
    </p>
    <p>
      He then sought out a stout stick, and divested it of twigs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pomp watched his preparations with terror. Too well he knew what they
      meant. More than once he had seen those of his own color whipped on the
      plantation. Unconsciously, he glided into the language which he would have
      used there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't whip me, Massa John,&rdquo; he whimpered in terror. &ldquo;For the lub of
      Heaven, lef me be. I ain't done noffin' to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'd better have thought of that before,&rdquo; said John, his eyes blazing
      anew with vengeful light. &ldquo;If I whip you, you little black rascal, it's
      only because you richly deserve it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll nebber do so again,&rdquo; pleaded Pomp, rolling his eyes in terror.
      Though what it was he promised not to do the poor little fellow would have
      found it hard to tell.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would have been as easy to soften the heart of a nether millstone as
      that of John Haynes.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time he had completed his preparations, and whirled his stick in
      the air preparatory to bringing it down with full force on Pomp's back,
      rapid steps were heard, and a voice asked, &ldquo;What are you doing there, John
      Haynes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John looked round, and saw standing near him Frank Frost, whose attention
      had been excited by what he had heard of Pomp's cries.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Save me, save me, Mass' Frank,&rdquo; pleaded poor little Pomp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has he tied you up there for, Pomp?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's none of your business, Frank Frost,&rdquo; said John passionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it's some of my business,&rdquo; said Frank coolly, &ldquo;when I find you
      playing the part of a Southern overseer. You are not in Richmond, John
      Haynes, and you'll get into trouble if you undertake to act as if you
      were.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you say much more, I'll flog you too!&rdquo; screamed John, beside himself
      with excitement and rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank had not a particle of cowardice in his composition. He was not fond
      of fighting, but he felt that circumstances made it necessary for him to
      do so now. He did not easily lose his temper, and this at present gave him
      the advantage over John.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are too excited to know what you are talking about,&rdquo; he said coolly.
      &ldquo;Pomp, why has he tied you up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pomp explained that John had tried to get his pail from him. He closed by
      imploring &ldquo;Mass' Frank&rdquo; to prevent John from whipping him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He shall not whip you, Pomp,&rdquo; said Frank quietly. As he spoke he stepped
      to the tree and faced John intrepidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      John, in a moment of less passion, would not have ventured to attack a boy
      so near his own size. Like all bullies, he was essentially a coward, but
      now his rage got the better of his prudence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll flog you both!&rdquo; he exclaimed hoarsely, and sprang forward with
      upraised stick.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank was about half a head shorter than John, and was more than a year
      younger, but he was stout and compactly built; besides, he was cool and
      collected, and this is always an advantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before John realized what had happened, his stick had flown from his hand,
      and he was forcibly pushed back, so that he narrowly escaped falling to
      the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gib it to him, Mass' Frank!&rdquo; shouted little Pomp. &ldquo;Gib it to him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This increased John's exasperation. By this time he was almost foaming at
      the mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll kill you, Frank Frost,&rdquo; he exclaimed, this time rushing at him
      without a stick.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank had been in the habit of wrestling for sport with the boys of his
      own size. In this way he had acquired a certain amount of dexterity in
      &ldquo;tripping up.&rdquo; John, on the contrary, was unpractised. His quick temper
      was so easily roused that other boys had declined engaging in friendly
      contests with him, knowing that in most cases they would degenerate into a
      fight.
    </p>
    <p>
      John rushed forward, and attempted to throw Frank by the strength of his
      arms alone. Frank eluded his grasp, and, getting one of his legs around
      John's, with a quick movement tripped him up. He fell heavily upon his
      back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is all foolish, John,&rdquo; said Frank, bending over his fallen foe.
      &ldquo;What are you fighting for? The privilege of savagely whipping a poor
      little fellow less than half your age?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I care more about whipping you, a cursed sight!&rdquo; said John, taking
      advantage of Frank's withdrawing his pressure to spring to his feet. &ldquo;You
      first, and him afterward!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again he threw himself upon Frank; but again coolness and practice
      prevailed against blind fury and untaught strength, and again he lay
      prostrate.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time Pomp had freed himself from the string that fettered his
      wrists, and danced in glee round John Haynes, in whose discomfiture he
      felt great delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'd better pick up your pail and run home,&rdquo; said Frank. He was
      generously desirous of saving John from further humiliation. &ldquo;Will you go
      away quietly if I will let you up, John?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, d&mdash;&mdash; you!&rdquo; returned John, writhing, his face almost livid
      with passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; said Frank, &ldquo;for in that case I must continue to hold you
      down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the trouble, boys?&rdquo; came from an unexpected quarter.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Mr. Maynard, who, chancing to pass along the road, had been
      attracted by the noise of the struggle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank explained in a few words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him up, Frank,&rdquo; said the old man. &ldquo;I'll see that he does no further
      harm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John rose to his feet, and looked scowlingly from one to the other, as if
      undecided whether he had not better attack both.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've disgraced yourself, John Haynes,&rdquo; said the old farmer scornfully.
      &ldquo;So you would turn negro-whipper, would you? Your talents are misapplied
      here at the North. Brutality isn't respectable here, my lad. You'd better
      find your way within the rebel lines, and then perhaps you can gratify
      your propensity for whipping the helpless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some day I'll be revenged on you for this,&rdquo; said John, turning wrathfully
      upon Frank. &ldquo;Perhaps you think I don't mean it, but the day will come when
      you'll remember what I say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you no harm, John,&rdquo; said Frank composedly, &ldquo;but I sha'n't stand by
      and see you beat a boy like Pomp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the farmer sternly; &ldquo;and if ever I hear of your doing it, I'll
      horsewhip you till you beg for mercy. Now go home, and carry your disgrace
      with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Maynard spoke contemptuously, but with decision, and pointed up the
      road.
    </p>
    <p>
      With smothered wrath John obeyed his order, because he saw that it would
      not be safe to refuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll come up with him yet,&rdquo; he muttered to himself, as he walked quietly
      toward home. &ldquo;If he doesn't rue this day, my name isn't John Haynes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John did not see fit to make known the circumstances of his quarrel with
      Frank, feeling, justly, that neither his design nor the result would
      reflect any credit upon himself. But his wrath was none the less deep
      because he brooded over it in secret. He would have renewed his attempt
      upon Pomp, but there was something in Mr. Maynard's eye which assured him
      that his threat would be carried out. Frank, solicitous for the little
      fellow's safety, kept vigilant watch over him for some days, but no
      violence was attempted. He hoped John had forgotten his threats.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII. A LETTER FROM THE CAMP
    </h2>
    <p>
      The little family at the Frost farm looked forward with anxious eagerness
      to the first letter from the absent father.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten days had elapsed when Frank was seen hurrying up the road with
      something in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice saw him first, and ran in, exclaiming, &ldquo;Mother, I do believe Frank
      has got a letter from father. He is running up the road.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Frost at once dropped her work, no less interested than her daughter,
      and was at the door just as Frank, flushed with running, reached the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What'll you give me for a letter?&rdquo; he asked triumphantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give it to me quick,&rdquo; said Mrs. Frost. &ldquo;I am anxious to learn whether
      your father is well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess he is, or he wouldn't have written such a long letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know it's long?&rdquo; asked Alice. &ldquo;You haven't read it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I judge from the weight. There are two stamps on the envelope. I was
      tempted to open it, but, being directed to mother, I didn't venture.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Frost sat down, and the children gathered round her, while she read
      the following letter:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                    &ldquo;CAMP &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, Virginia.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DEAR MARY: When I look about me, and consider the novelty and strangeness
      of my surroundings, I can hardly realize that it is only a week since I
      sat in our quiet sitting-room at the farm, with you and our own dear ones
      around me. I will try to help your imagination to a picture of my present
      home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But first let me speak of my journey hither.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was tedious enough, traveling all day by rail. Of course, little
      liberty was allowed us. Military discipline is rigid, and must be
      maintained. Of its necessity we had a convincing proof at a small station
      between Hartford and New Haven. One of our number, who, I accidentally
      learned, is a Canadian, and had only been tempted to enlist by the bounty,
      selected a seat by the door of the car. I had noticed for some time that
      he looked nervous and restless, as if he had something on his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At one of our stopping-places&mdash;a small, obscure station&mdash;he
      crept out of the door, and, as he thought, unobserved, dodged behind a
      shed, thinking, no doubt, that the train would go off without him. But an
      officer had his eye upon him, and a minute afterward he was ignominiously
      brought back and put under guard. I am glad to say that his case inspired
      no sympathy. To enlist, obtain a bounty, and then attempt to evade the
      service for which the bounty was given, is despicable in the extreme. I am
      glad to know that no others of our company had the least desire to follow
      this man's example.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We passed through New York, Philadelphia, and Washington, but I can give
      you little idea of either of these cities. The time we passed in each was
      mostly during the hours of darkness, when there was little opportunity of
      seeing anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In Washington I was fortunate enough to see our worthy President. We were
      marching down Pennsylvania Avenue at the time. On the opposite side of the
      street we descried a very tall man, of slender figure, walking
      thoughtfully along, not appearing to notice what was passing around him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The officer in command turned and said: 'Boys, look sharp. That is
      Abraham Lincoln, across the way.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, we all looked eagerly toward the man of whom we had heard so
      much.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could not help thinking how great a responsibility rests upon this man&mdash;to
      how great an extent the welfare and destinies of our beloved country
      depend upon his patriotic course.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I noticed his features, which, plain as they are, bear the
      unmistakable marks of a shrewd benevolence, and evince also, as I think,
      acute and original powers of mind, I felt reassured. I could not help
      saying to myself: 'This man is at least honest, and if he does not carry
      us in safety through this tremendous crisis, it will not be for the lack
      of an honest determination to do his duty.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now let me attempt to give you a picture of our present situation,
      with some account of the way we live.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our camp may appropriately be called 'Hut Village.' Imagine several
      avenues lined with square log huts, surmounted by tent-coverings. The logs
      are placed transversely, and are clipped at the ends, so as to fit each
      other more compactly. In this way the interstices are made much narrower
      than they would otherwise be. These, moreover, are filled in with mud,
      which, as you have probably heard, is a staple production of Virginia.
      This is a good protection against the cold, though it does not give our
      dwellings a very elegant appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Around most of our huts shallow trenches are dug, to carry off the water,
      thus diminishing the dampness. Most of the huts are not floored, but mine,
      fortunately, is an exception to the general rule. My comrades succeeded in
      obtaining some boards somewhere, and we are a little in advance of our
      neighbors in this respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Six of us are lodged in a tent. It is pretty close packing, but we don't
      stand upon ceremony here. My messmates seem to be pleasant fellows. I have
      been most attracted to Frank Grover; a bright young fellow of eighteen. He
      tells me that he is an only son, and his mother is a widow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Wasn't your mother unwilling to have you come out here?' I asked him one
      day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'No,' he answered, 'not unwilling. She was only sorry for the necessity.
      When I told her that I felt it to be my duty, she told me at once to go.
      She said she would never stand between me and my country.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'You must think of her often,' I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'All the time,' he answered seriously, a thoughtful expression stealing
      over his young face. 'I write to her twice a week regular, and sometimes
      oftener. For her sake I hope my life may be spared to return.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I hope so, too,' I answered warmly. Then after a minute's silence, I
      added from some impulse: 'Will you let me call you Frank? I have a boy at
      home, not many years younger than you. His name is Frank also&mdash;it
      will seem to remind me of him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I wish you would,' he answered, his face lighting up with evident
      pleasure. 'Everybody calls me Frank at home, and I am tired of being
      called Grover.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So our compact was made. I shall feel a warm interest in this brave boy,
      and I fervently hope that the chances of war will leave him unscathed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must give you a description of Hiram Marden, another of our small
      company, a very different kind of person from Frank Grover. But it takes
      all sorts of characters to make an army, as well as a world, and Marden is
      one of the oddities. Imagine a tall young fellow, with a thin face,
      lantern jaws, and long hair 'slicked' down on either side. Though he may
      be patriotic, he was led into the army from a different cause. He
      cherished an attachment for a village beauty, who did not return his love.
      He makes no concealment of his rebuff, but appears to enjoy discoursing in
      a sentimental way upon his disappointment. He wears such an air of meek
      resignation when he speaks of his cruel fair one that the effect is quite
      irresistible, and I find it difficult to accord him that sympathy which
      his unhappy fate demands. Fortunately for him, his troubles, deep-seated
      as they are, appear to have very little effect upon his appetite. He sits
      down to his rations with a look of subdued sorrow upon his face, and sighs
      frequently between the mouthfuls. In spite of this, however, he seldom
      leaves anything upon his tin plate, which speaks well for his appetite,
      since Uncle Sam is a generous provider, and few of us do full justice to
      our allowance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may wonder how I enjoy soldier's fare. I certainly do long sometimes
      for the good pumpkin and apple pies which I used to have at home, and
      confess that a little apple sauce would make my hardtack a little more
      savory. I begin to appreciate your good qualities as a housekeeper, Mary,
      more than ever. Pies can be got of the sutler, but they are such poor
      things that I would rather do without than eat them, and I am quite sure
      they would try my digestion sorely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is one very homely esculent which we crave in the camp&mdash;I mean
      the onion. It is an excellent preventive of scurvy, a disease to which our
      mode of living particularly exposes us. We eat as many as we can get, and
      should be glad of more. Tell Frank he may plant a whole acre of them. They
      will require considerable care, but even in a pecuniary way they will pay.
      The price has considerably advanced since the war began, on account of the
      large army demand, and will doubtless increase more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As to our military exercises, drill, etc., we have enough to occupy our
      time well. I see the advantage of enlisting in a veteran regiment. I find
      myself improving very rapidly. Besides my public company drill, I am
      getting my young comrade, Frank Grover, who has been in the service six
      months, to give me some private lessons. With the help of these, I hope to
      pass muster creditably before my first month is out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, my dear Mary, I must draw my letter to a close. In the army we
      are obliged to write under difficulties. I am writing this on my knapsack
      for a desk, and that is not quite so easy as a table. The constrained
      position in which I am forced to sit has tired me, and I think I will go
      out and 'limber' myself a little. Frank, who has just finished a letter to
      his mother, will no doubt join me. Two of my comrades are sitting close
      by, playing euchre. When I joined them I found they were in the habit of
      playing for small stakes, but I have succeeded in inducing them to give up
      a practice which might not unlikely lead to bad results.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In closing, I need not tell you how much and how often I think of you
      all. I have never before been separated from you, and there are times when
      my longing to be with you again is very strong. You must make up for your
      absence by frequent and long letters. Tell me all that is going on. Even
      trifles will serve to amuse us here.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell Frank to send me Harper's Weekly regularly. Two or three times a
      week I should like to have a daily paper forwarded. Every newspaper that
      finds its way into camp goes the rounds, and its contents are eagerly
      devoured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will write you again very soon. The letters I write and receive from
      home will be one of my principal sources of pleasure. God bless you all,
      is the prayer of your affectionate husband and father,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;HENRY FROST.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is hardly necessary to say that this letter was read with eager
      interest. That evening all the children, including little Charlie, were
      busy writing letters to the absent father. I have not room to print them
      all, but as this was Charlie's first epistolary effort, it may interest
      some of my youthful readers to see it. The mistakes in spelling will be
      excused on the score of Charlie's literary inexperience. This is the way
      it commenced:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DEER FARTHER: I am sorry you hav to live in a log hous stuck up with mud.
      I shud think the mud wood cum off on your close. I am wel and so is
      Maggie. Frank is agoin to make me a sled&mdash;a real good one. I shal cal
      it the egle. I hope we shal soon hav sum sno. It will be my berth day next
      week. I shal be seven years old. I hope you cum back soon. Good nite.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;from CHARLIE.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Charlie was so proud of his letter that he insisted on having it enclosed
      in a separate envelope and mailed by itself&mdash;a request which was
      complied with by his mother.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII. MISCHIEF ON FOOT
    </h2>
    <p>
      As may be supposed, John Haynes was deeply incensed with Frank Frost for
      the manner in which he had foiled him in his attack upon Pomp. He felt
      that in this whole matter he had appeared by no means to advantage. After
      all his boasting, he had been defeated by a boy younger and smaller than
      himself. The old grudge which he had against Frank for the success gained
      over him at school increased and added poignancy to his mortification. He
      felt that he should never be satisfied until he had &ldquo;come up&rdquo; with Frank
      in some way. The prospect of seeing him ejected from the farm was
      pleasant, but it was too far off. John did not feel like waiting so long
      for the gratification of his revengeful feelings. He resolved in the
      meantime to devise some method of injuring or annoying Frank.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could not at once think of anything feasible. Several schemes flitted
      across his mind, but all were open to some objection. John did not care to
      attempt anything which would expose him, if discovered, to a legal
      punishment. I am afraid this weighed more with him than the wrong or
      injustice of his schemes.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last it occurred to him that Mr. Frost kept a couple of pigs. To let
      them out secretly at night would be annoying to Frank, as they would
      probably stray quite a distance, and thus a tedious pursuit would be made
      necessary. Perhaps they might never be found, in which case John felt that
      he should not grieve much.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon this scheme John finally settled as the one promising the most
      amusement to himself and annoyance to his enemy, as he chose to regard
      Frank. He felt quite averse, however, to doing the work himself. In the
      first place, it must be done by night, and he could not absent himself
      from the house at a late hour without his father's knowledge. Again, he
      knew there was a risk of being caught, and it would not sound very well if
      noised abroad that the son of Squire Haynes had gone out by night and let
      loose a neighbor's pigs.
    </p>
    <p>
      He cast about in his mind for a confederate, and after awhile settled upon
      a boy named Dick Bumstead.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Dick had the reputation of being a scape-grace and a ne'er-do-well.
      He was about the age of John Haynes, but had not attended school for a
      couple of years, and, less from want of natural capacity than from
      indolence, knew scarcely more than a boy of ten. His father was a
      shoemaker, and had felt obliged to keep his son at home to assist him in
      the shop. He did not prove a very efficient assistant, however, being
      inclined to shirk duty whenever he could.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was upon this boy that John Haynes fixed as most likely to help him in
      his plot. On his way home from school the next afternoon, he noticed Dick
      loitering along a little in advance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold on, Dick,&rdquo; he called out, in a friendly voice, at the same time
      quickening his pace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dick turned in some surprise, for John Haynes had a foolish pride, which
      had hitherto kept him very distant toward those whom he regarded as
      standing lower than himself in the social scale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are you, John?&rdquo; he responded, putting up the knife with which he had
      been whittling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. What are you up to nowadays?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Working in the shop,&rdquo; said Dick, shrugging his shoulders. &ldquo;I wish people
      didn't wear shoes, for my part. I've helped make my share. Pegging isn't a
      very interesting operation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said John, with remarkable affability. &ldquo;I shouldn't think there'd be
      much fun in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fun! I guess not. For my part, I'd be willing to go barefoot, if other
      people would, for the sake of getting rid of pegging.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you have some time to yourself, though, don't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precious little. I ought to be in the shop now. Father sent me down to
      the store for some awls, and he'll be fretting because I don't get back. I
      broke my awl on purpose,&rdquo; said Dick, laughing, &ldquo;so as to get a chance to
      run out a little while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose your father gives you some of the money that you earn, doesn't
      he?' inquired John.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A few cents now and then; that's all. He says everything is so high
      nowadays that it takes all we can both of us earn to buy food and clothes.
      So if a fellow wants a few cents now and then to buy a cigar, he can't
      have 'em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John was glad to hear this. He felt that he could the more readily induce
      Dick to assist him in his plans.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dick!&rdquo; he said abruptly, looking round to see that no one was within
      hearing-distance, &ldquo;wouldn't you like to earn a two-dollar bill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For myself?&rdquo; inquired Dick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there much work in it?&rdquo; asked indolent Dick cautiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, and what little there is will be fun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I'm in for it. That is, I think I am. What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll promise not to tell?&rdquo; said John.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Honor bright.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's only a little practical joke that I want to play upon one of the
      boys.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On who?&rdquo; asked Dick, unmindful of his grammar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On Frank Frost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frank's a pretty good fellow. It isn't going to hurt him any, is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, of course not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I wouldn't want to do that. He's always treated me well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course he has. It's only a little joke, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well, if it's a joke, just count me in. Fire away, and let me know
      what you want done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know that Frank, or his father, keeps pigs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want you to go some night&mdash;the sooner the better&mdash;and let
      them out, so that when morning comes the pigs will be minus, and Master
      Frank will have a fine chase after them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seems to me,&rdquo; said Dick, &ldquo;that won't be much of a joke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I guess you never saw a pig-chase. Pigs are so contrary that if you
      want them to go in one direction they are sure to go in another. The way
      they gallop over the ground, with their little tails wriggling behind
      them, is a caution.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it would be a great trouble to Frank to get them back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well, you could help him, and so get still more fun out of it, he not
      knowing, of course, that you had anything to do with letting them out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that would take me out of the shop for a couple of hours,&rdquo; said Dick,
      brightening at the thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said John; &ldquo;so you would get a double advantage. Come, what
      do you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don't know,&rdquo; said Dick, wavering. &ldquo;You'd pay me the money down on
      the nail, wouldn't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said John. &ldquo;I'll show you the bill now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took from his pocketbook a two-dollar greenback, and displayed it to
      Dick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You could buy cigars enough with this to last you some time,&rdquo; he said
      insinuatingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I could. I declare, I've a good mind to take up your offer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'd better. It's a good one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why don't you do it yourself?&rdquo; asked Dick, with sudden wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because father's very strict,&rdquo; said John glibly, &ldquo;and if I should leave
      the house at night, he'd be sure to find it out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's where I have the advantage. I sleep downstairs, and can easily
      slip out of the window, without anybody's being the wiser.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just the thing. Then you agree?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I might as well. Are you particular about the night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, take your choice about that. Only the sooner the better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two boys separated, John feeling quite elated with his success.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV. A RAID UPON THE PIG-PEN
    </h2>
    <p>
      The more Dick thought of the enterprise which he had undertaken, the more
      he disliked it. He relished fun as much as any one, but he could not
      conceal from himself that he would be subjecting Frank to a great deal of
      trouble and annoyance. As he had told John, Frank had always treated him
      well, and this thought made the scheme disagreeable to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, John had promised him two dollars for his co-operation, and this,
      in his circumstances, was an important consideration. Unfortunately, Dick
      had contracted a fondness for smoking&mdash;a habit which his scanty
      supply of pocket-money rarely enabled him to indulge. This windfall would
      keep him in cigars for some time. It was this reflection which finally
      turned the wavering scale of Dick's irresolution, and determined him to
      embrace John's offer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moon was now at the full, and the nights were bright and beautiful.
      Dick decided that it would be best to defer the accomplishment of his
      purpose till later in the month, when darker nights would serve as a
      screen, and render detection more difficult.
    </p>
    <p>
      By and by a night came which he thought suitable. A few stars were out,
      but they gave only a faint glimmer of light, not more than was necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dick went to bed at nine o'clock, as usual. By an effort he succeeded in
      keeping awake, feeling that if he once yielded to drowsiness, he should
      probably sleep on till morning. At half-past nine all in the house were
      abed. It was not till eleven, however, that Dick felt it safe to leave the
      house. He dressed himself expeditiously and in silence, occasionally
      listening to see if he could detect any sound in the room above, where his
      parents slept. Finally he raised the window softly, and jumped out. He
      crept out to the road, and swiftly bent his steps toward Mr. Frost's
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      As this was not more than a third of a mile distant, a very few minutes
      sufficed to bring him to his destination. Dick's feelings were not the
      most comfortable. Though he repeatedly assured himself that it was only
      fun he was engaged in, he felt very much like a burglar about to enter a
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrived before the farmhouse, he looked cautiously up to the windows, but
      could see no light burning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The coast is clear,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;I wish it were all over, and I were on
      my way home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dick had not reconnoitered thoroughly. There was a light burning in a
      window at the other end of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pig-pen was a small, rough, unpainted building, with a yard opening
      from it. Around the yard was a stone wall, which prevented the pigs from
      making their escape. They were now, as Dick could with difficulty see,
      stretched out upon the floor of the pen, asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dick proceeded to remove a portion of the stones forming the wall. It was
      not very easy or agreeable work, the stones being large and heavy. At
      length he effected a gap which he thought would be large enough for the
      pigs to pass through. He next considered whether it would be better to
      disturb the slumbers of the pigs by poking them with a hoe, or wait and
      let them find out the avenue of escape in the morning. He finally decided
      to stir them up. He accordingly went round to the door and, seizing a hoe,
      commenced punching one of the pigs vigorously.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pig whose slumbers were thus rudely disturbed awoke with a loud grunt,
      and probably would have looked astonished and indignant if nature had
      given him the power of expressing such emotions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get out, there, you lazy beast,&rdquo; exclaimed Dick.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pig, as was perhaps only natural under the circumstances, seemed
      reluctant to get up, and was by no means backward in grunting his
      discontent. Dick was earnestly engaged in overcoming his repugnance to
      locomotion, when he was startled by hearing the door of the building,
      which he had carefully closed, open slowly. Looking up hastily, the hoe
      still in his hand, his dismayed glance fell upon Frank Frost, entering
      with a lantern.
    </p>
    <p>
      A half-exclamation of surprise and dismay escaped him. This called the
      attention of Frank, who till that moment was unsuspicious of Dick's
      presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dick Bumstead!&rdquo; he exclaimed, as soon as he recognized the intruder.
      &ldquo;What brings you here at this time of night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A mean errand, Frank,&rdquo; returned Dick, with a wholesome feeling of shame.
      He had made up his mind to a confession.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn't come here to&mdash;to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Here Frank stopped short.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not to steal. I ain't quite so mean as that comes to. I come to let
      out your pigs, so that in the morning you would have a long chase after
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what could put such a thing into your head, Dick?&rdquo; asked Frank, in
      great surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought it would be a good joke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wouldn't have been much of a joke to me,&rdquo; said Frank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; and to tell the truth it wouldn't have been to me. The fact is, and I
      don't mind telling it, that I should never have thought of such a thing if
      somebody else hadn't put it into my head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somebody else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I'd a little rather not tell who that somebody is, for I don't
      believe he would like to have you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn't he come himself?&rdquo; asked Frank. &ldquo;It seems to me he's been
      making a catspaw of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A catspaw?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, haven't you read the story? A monkey wanted to draw some chestnuts
      out of the hot ashes, but, feeling a decided objection to burning his own
      paws in the operation, drew a cat to the fire and thrust her paw in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know but it's been so in my case,&rdquo; said Dick. &ldquo;I didn't want to
      do it, and that's a fact. I felt as mean as could be when I first came
      into your yard to-night. But he offered me two dollars to do it, and it's
      so seldom I see money that it tempted me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frank looked puzzled. &ldquo;I don't see,&rdquo; he said thoughtfully, &ldquo;how anybody
      should think it worth while to pay two dollars for such a piece of
      mischief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps he don't like you, and wanted to plague you,&rdquo; suggested Dick.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thought at once flashed upon Frank that John Haynes must be
      implicated. He was the only boy who was likely to have two dollars to
      invest in this way, and the suggestion offered by Dick of personal enmity
      was sufficient to supply a motive for his action.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe I know who it is, now, Dick,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;However, I
      won't ask you to tell me. There is one boy in the village who thinks he
      has cause of complaint against me, though I have never intentionally
      injured him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shall you do about it, Frank?&rdquo; asked Dick, a little awkwardly, for
      he did not want his own agency made public.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; answered Frank. &ldquo;I would rather take no notice of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At any rate, I hope you won't think hard of me,&rdquo; said Dick. &ldquo;You have
      always treated me well, and I didn't want to trouble you. But the money
      tempted me. I meant to buy cigars with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't smoke, Dick?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, when I get a chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn't if I were you. It isn't good for boys like you and me. It is
      an expensive habit, and injurious, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know but you are right, Frank,&rdquo; said Dick candidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know I am. You can leave off now, Dick, better than when you are
      older.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment a voice was heard from the house, calling &ldquo;Frank!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came out for some herbs,&rdquo; said Frank hurriedly. &ldquo;Jacob isn't very well,
      and mother is going to make him some herb tea. I won't mention that I have
      seen you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. Thank you, Frank.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A minute later Frank went into the house, leaving Dick by himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; thought Dick, &ldquo;I must try to remedy the mischief I have done. I'm
      afraid I've got a job before me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went round to the gap in the wall, and began to lay it again as well as
      he could. In lifting the heavy stones he began to realize how much easier
      it is to make mischief than to repair damages afterward. He pulled and
      tugged, but it took him a good half-hour, and by that time he felt very
      tired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My clothes must be precious dirty,&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;At any rate, my
      hands are. I wonder where the pump is. But then it won't do to pump; it'll
      make too much noise. Oh, here's some water in the trough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dick succeeded in getting some of the dirt off his hands, which he dried
      on his handkerchief. Then with a feeling of relief, he took the road
      toward home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although he may be said to have failed most signally in his design, he
      felt considerably better than if he had succeeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frank's a good fellow,&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;Some boys would have been
      mad, and made a great fuss. But he didn't seem angry at all, not even with
      John Haynes, and did all he could to screen me. Well I'm glad I didn't
      succeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dick reached home without any further mischance, and succeeded in crawling
      in at the window without making any sound loud enough to wake up his
      parents.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day John, who had been informed of his intention to make the
      attempt the evening previous, contrived to meet him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Dick,&rdquo; he said eagerly, &ldquo;what success last night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None at all,&rdquo; answered Dick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't you try?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What prevented your succeeding, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frank came out to get some herbs to make tea for the hired man, and so
      caught me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn't tell him who put you up to it?&rdquo; said John apprehensively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Dick coolly; &ldquo;I don't do such things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's good,&rdquo; said John, relieved. &ldquo;Was he mad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he didn't make any fuss. He asked what made me do it, and I told him
      somebody else put it into my head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did! I thought you said you didn't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't tell who that somebody was, but Frank said he could guess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He can't prove it,&rdquo; said John hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think he'll try,&rdquo; said Dick. &ldquo;The fact is, John, Frank's a good
      fellow, and if you want to get anybody to do him any mischief hereafter,
      you'd better not apply to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know as he's any better than other boys,&rdquo; said John, sneering. He
      did not enjoy hearing Frank's praises.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's better than either of us, I'm sure of that,&rdquo; said Dick decidedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak for yourself, Dick Bumstead,&rdquo; said John haughtily. &ldquo;I wouldn't
      lower myself by a comparison with him. He's only a laborer, and will grow
      up a clodhopper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's my friend, John Haynes,&rdquo; said Dick stoutly, &ldquo;and if you've got
      anything else to say against him, you'll oblige me by going farther off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John left in high dudgeon.
    </p>
    <p>
      That day, to his father's surprise, Dick worked with steady industry, and
      did not make a single attempt to shirk.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV. POMP BEHAVES BADLY
    </h2>
    <p>
      The village of Rossville was distant about five miles from the long line
      of railway which binds together with iron bands the cities of New York and
      Boston. Only when the wind was strongly that way could the monotonous
      noise of the railway-train be heard, as the iron monster, with its heavy
      burden, sped swiftly on its way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lately a covered wagon had commenced running twice a day between Rossville
      and the railway-station at Wellington. It was started at seven in the
      morning, in time to meet the early trains, and again at four, in order to
      receive any passengers who might have left the city in the afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Occupying a central position in the village stood the tavern&mdash;a
      two-story building, with a long piazza running along the front. Here an
      extended seat was provided, on which, when the weather was not too
      inclement, the floating population of the village, who had plenty of
      leisure, and others when their work was over for the day, liked to
      congregate, and in neighborly chat discuss the affairs of the village, or
      the nation, speculating perchance upon the varying phases of the great
      civil contest, which, though raging hundreds of miles away, came home to
      the hearts and hearths of quiet Rossville and every other village and
      hamlet in the land.
    </p>
    <p>
      The driver of the carriage which made its daily journeys to and fro from
      the station had received from his parents the rather uncommon name of
      Ajax, not probably from any supposed resemblance to the ancient Grecian
      hero, of whom it is doubtful whether his worthy progenitor had ever heard.
      He had been at one time a driver on a horse-car in New York, but had
      managed to find his way from the busy hum of the city to quiet Rossville,
      where he was just in time for an employment similar to the one he had
      given up.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, early in November, a young man of slight figure, apparently not
      far from twenty-five years of age, descended from the cars at the
      Wellington station and, crossing the track, passed through the small
      station-house to the rear platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you tell me,&rdquo; he inquired of a bystander, &ldquo;whether there is any
      conveyance between this place and Rossville?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;That's the regular carriage, and here's the
      driver. Ajax, here's a passenger for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a trunk on the other side,&rdquo; said the young man, addressing the
      driver. &ldquo;If you wild go round with me, we will bring it here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, sir,&rdquo; said Ajax, in a businesslike way.
    </p>
    <p>
      The trunk was brought round and placed on the rack behind the wagon. It
      was a large black trunk, securely bound with brass bands, and showed marks
      of service, as if it had been considerably used. Two small strips of paper
      pasted on the side bore the custom-house marks of Havre and Liverpool. On
      one end was a large card, on which, written in large, bold letters, was
      the name of the proprietor, Henry Morton.
    </p>
    <p>
      In five minutes the &ldquo;express&rdquo; got under way. The road wound partly through
      the woods. In some places the boughs, bending over from opposite sides,
      nearly met. At present the branches were nearly destitute of leaves, and
      the landscape looked bleak. But in the summer nothing could be more
      charming.
    </p>
    <p>
      From his seat, beside Ajax, Henry Morton regarded attentively the
      prominent features of the landscape. His survey was interrupted by a
      question from the driver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you calc'latin' to make a long stay in our village?&rdquo; inquired Ajax,
      with Yankee freedom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not quite certain. It is possible that I may.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There isn't much goin' on in winter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I suppose not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a few minutes' pause, he inquired, &ldquo;Can you tell me if there is a
      gentleman living in the village named Haynes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expect you mean Squire Haynes,&rdquo; said Ajax.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very probably he goes by that name. He was formerly a lawyer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that's the man. Do you know him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have heard of him,&rdquo; said the young man, non-committally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you ain't going to stop there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An expression of repugnance swept over the young man's face, as he hastily
      answered in the negative.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time they had come to a turn in the road. This brought them in
      view of Chloe's cottage. Little Pomp was on all fours, hunting for nuts
      among the fallen leaves under the shagbark-tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the influence of some freakish impulse, Pomp suddenly jumped to his
      feet and, whirling his arms aloft, uttered a wild whoop. Startled by the
      unexpected apparition, the horses gave a sudden start, and nearly
      succeeded in overturning the wagon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Massy on us!&rdquo; exclaimed an old lady on the back seat, suddenly flinging
      her arms round young Morton's neck, in the height of her consternation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, marm,&rdquo; said Ajax reassuringly, after a brief but successful
      conflict with the horses. &ldquo;We sha'n't go over this time. I should like to
      give that little black imp a good shaking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I've lost my ban'box, with my best bunnit,&rdquo; hastily exclaimed the old
      lady. &ldquo;Le' me get out and find it. It was a present from my darter, Cynthy
      Ann, and I wouldn't lose it for a kingdom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In truth, when prompted by her apprehension to cling to the young man in
      front for protection, Mrs. Payson had inadvertently dropped the bandbox
      out of the window, where it met with an unhappy disaster. The horse, quite
      unconscious of the damage he was doing, had backed the wagon in such a
      manner that one of the wheels passed directly over it.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Ajax picked up the mutilated casket, which, with the jewel it
      contained, had suffered such irreparable injury, and restored it to its
      owner, great was the lamentation. Rachel weeping for her children could
      hardly have exhibited more poignant sorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it's sp'ilt!&rdquo; groaned the old lady. &ldquo;I can never wear it arter this.
      And it cost four dollars and sixty-two cents and a half without the
      ribbon. Oh, deary me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, suddenly waxing indignant with the author of the mischief, she put
      her head out of the window, and, espying Pomp on the other side of the
      stone wall, looking half-repentant and half-struck with the fun of the
      thing, she shook her fist at him, exclaiming, &ldquo;Oh, you little sarpint, ef
      I only had you here, I'd w'ip you till you couldn't stan'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pomp was so far from being terrified by this menace that he burst into a
      loud guffaw. This, of course, added fuel to the flame of the old lady's
      wrath, and filled her with thoughts of immediate vengeance. Her sympathy
      with the oppressed black race was at that moment very small.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jest lend me your w'ip, driver,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;an' I'll l'arn that sassy imp
      to make fun of his elders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ajax, whose sense of humor was tickled by the old lady's peculiarities,
      quietly took her at her word, and coming round to the side opened the door
      of the carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, ma'am,&rdquo; said he, extending the whip. &ldquo;Don't spare him. He deserves
      a flogging.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Payson, her eyes flashing from beneath her glasses with a vengeful
      light, seized the proffered whip with alacrity, and jumped out of the
      wagon with a lightness which could hardly have been anticipated of one of
      her age.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, look out,&rdquo; she said, brandishing the whip in a menacing way. &ldquo;I'll
      git pay for that bunnit in one way, ef I don't in another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pomp maintained his position on the other side of the wall. He waited till
      the old lady was fairly over, and then commenced running. The old lady
      pursued with vindictive animosity, cracking the whip in a suggestive
      manner. Pomp doubled and turned in a most provoking way. Finally he had
      recourse to a piece of strategy. He had flung himself, doubled up in a
      ball, at the old lady's feet, and she, unable to check her speed, fell
      over him, clutching at the ground with her outstretched hands, from which
      the whip had fallen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hi, hi!&rdquo; shrieked Pomp, with a yell of inconceivable delight, as he
      watched the signal downfall of his adversary. Springing quickly to his
      feet, he ran swiftly away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good for you, you old debble!&rdquo; he cried from a safe distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry Morton, though he found it difficult to restrain his laughter,
      turned to Ajax and said, &ldquo;I think it's time we interfered. If you'll
      overtake the little black boy and give him a shaking up, just to keep him
      out of mischief hereafter, I'll go and help the old lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ajax started on his errand. Pomp, now really alarmed, strove to escape
      from this more formidable adversary, but in vain. He was destined to
      receive a summary castigation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, the young man approached Mrs. Payson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you're not much hurt, madam,&rdquo; said he respectfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expect about every bone in my body's broke,&rdquo; she groaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Raising her to her feet, it became manifest that the damage was limited to
      a pair of hands begrimed by contact with the earth. Nevertheless, the old
      lady persisted that &ldquo;something or 'nother was broke. She didn't feel quite
      right inside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn't keer so much,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;ef I'd caught that aggravatin'
      boy. I'd go fifty miles to see him hung. He'll die on the gallows, jest as
      sure's I stan' here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment a shrill cry was heard, which could proceed from no one but
      Pomp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Golly, Mass' Jack, don't hit so hard. Couldn't help it, sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll have to help it the next time, you little rascal!&rdquo; responded Ajax.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Le' me go. I hope to be killed if I ever do it ag'in,&rdquo; pleaded Pomp,
      dancing about in pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you gin it to him,&rdquo; said the old lady, as the driver reappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ajax smiled grimly. &ldquo;I touched him up a little,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my poor bunnit!&rdquo; groaned Mrs. Payson, once more, as her eyes fell
      upon the crushed article. &ldquo;What will Cynthy Ann say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps a milliner can restore it for you,&rdquo; suggested Henry Morton, with
      an attempt at consolation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old lady shook her head disconsolately. &ldquo;It's all jammed out of
      shape,&rdquo; she said dismally, &ldquo;an' the flowers is all mashed up. Looks as ef
      an elephant had trodden on to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you are the only one of us that has suffered,&rdquo; said the young man
      politely, &ldquo;I think it only fair that your loss should be lightened. Will
      you accept this toward making it good?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He drew from his portemonnaie a five-dollar greenback, as he spoke, and
      offered it to Mrs. Payson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you in airnest?&rdquo; inquired the old lady dubiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ain't robbin' yourself, be you?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Payson, with a look of
      subdued eagerness lighting up her wrinkled face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no; I can spare it perfectly well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I'll take it,&rdquo; she responded, in evident gratification, &ldquo;an' I'm
      sure I'm much obleeged to you. I'm free to confess that you're a gentleman
      sech as I don't often meet with. I wouldn't take it on no account, only
      the loss is considerable for me, and Cynthy Ann, she would have been
      disapp'inted if so be as I hadn't worn the bunnit. I'd like to know who it
      is that I'm so much obligated to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Henry Morton drew a card from his card-case and handed it with a bow to
      Mrs. Payson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's that?&rdquo; asked the old lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My card.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Le's see, where's my specs?&rdquo; said Mrs. Payson, fumbling in her pocket.
      &ldquo;Oh, I've got 'em on. So your name's Herod. What made 'em call you that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Henry, madam&mdash;Henry Morton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, so 'tis, I declare. You ain't related to Nahum Morton, of Gilead,
      be you; he that was put into the State's prison for breakin' open the
      Gilead Bank?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An amused smile overspread the young man's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never had any relatives sent to the State's prison,&rdquo; he answered;
      &ldquo;though I think it quite possible that some of them may have deserved it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jest so,&rdquo; assented the old lady. &ldquo;There's a good deal of iniquity that
      never comes to light. I once know'd a woman that killed her husband with
      the tongs, and nobody ever surmised it; though everybody thought it
      strange that he should disappear so suddint. Well, this woman on her
      death-bed owned up to the tongs in a crazy fit that she had. But the most
      cur'us part of it,&rdquo; the old lady added rather illogically, &ldquo;was, that the
      man was livin' all the while, and it was all his wife's fancy that she'd
      struck him with the tongs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By this time the &ldquo;express&rdquo; had rumbled into the main street of Rossville,
      and the old lady had hardly completed her striking illustration of the
      truth, that murder will out, before they had drawn up in front of the
      tavern.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ain't you a-goin' to carry me to my darter's house?&rdquo; she inquired with
      solicitude. &ldquo;I can't walk noway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, ma'am,&rdquo; answered Ajax, &ldquo;directly, just as soon as this gentleman's
      got out, and they've taken the mail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He tossed the mail-bag to a small boy who stood on the piazza in waiting
      to receive it, and then, whipping up his horses, speedily conveyed Mrs.
      Payson to her destination.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's a very nice, obleeging young man,&rdquo; said the old lady, referring to
      Henry Morton. &ldquo;I wonder ef his mother was a Bent. There's old Micajah
      Bent's third daughter, Roxana Jane, married a Morton, or it might have
      been a Moulton. Ever see him afore?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, ma'am. Here you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I be! and there's Reuben at the gate. How are ye all? Jest take this
      carpetbag, will ye, and I'll give you a cent some time or 'nother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Reuben did not appear much elated by this promise. It had been made too
      many times without fulfilment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old lady having reached her destination, we take leave of her for the
      present, promising to resume her acquaintance in subsequent chapters.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI. FRANK MAKES A FRIEND
    </h2>
    <p>
      Henry Morton rose with the sun. This was not so early as may be supposed,
      for already November had touched its middle point, and the tardy sun did
      not make its appearance till nearly seven o'clock. As he passed through
      the hall he noticed that breakfast was not quite ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little walk will sharpen my appetite,&rdquo; he thought. He put on his hat,
      and, passing through the stable-yard at the rear, climbed over a fence and
      ascended a hill which he had observed from his chamber window. The sloping
      sides, which had not yet wholly lost their appearance of verdure, were
      dotted with trees, mostly apple-trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be delightful in summer,&rdquo; said the young man, as he looked
      thoughtfully about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hill was by no means high, and five minutes' walk brought him to the
      summit. From this spot he had a fine view of the village which lay at his
      feet embowered in trees. A narrow river wound like a silver thread through
      the landscape. Groups of trees on either bank bent over as if to see
      themselves reflected in the rapid stream. At one point a dam had been
      built across from bank to bank, above which the river widened and
      deepened, affording an excellent skating-ground for the boys in the cold
      days of December and January. A whirring noise was heard. The grist-mill
      had just commenced its work for the day. Down below the dam the shallow
      water eddied and whirled, breaking in fleecy foam over protuberant rocks
      which lay in the river-bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old village church with its modest proportions occupied a knoll
      between the hill and the river. It was girdled about with firs
      intermingled with elms. Near-by was a small triangular common, thickly
      planted with trees, each facing a separate street. Houses clustered here
      and there. Comfortable buildings they were, but built evidently rather for
      use than show. The architect had not yet come to the assistance of the
      village carpenter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seen in the cheering light of the rising sun, Henry Morton could not help
      feeling that a beautiful picture was spread out before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After all,&rdquo; he said thoughtfully, &ldquo;we needn't go abroad for beauty, when
      we can find so much of it at our own doors. Yet, perhaps the more we see
      of the beautiful, the better we are fitted to appreciate it in the
      wonderful variety of its numberless forms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He slowly descended the hill, but in a different direction. This brought
      him to the road that connected the village with North Rossville, two miles
      distant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coming from a different direction, a boy reached the stile about the same
      time with himself, and both clambered over together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a beautiful morning,&rdquo; said the young man courteously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; was the respectful answer. &ldquo;Have you been up looking at the
      view?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;and to get an appetite for breakfast. And you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frank Frost&mdash;for it was he&mdash;laughed. &ldquo;Oh, I am here on quite a
      different errand,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I used to come here earlier in the season to
      drive the cows to pasture. I come this morning to carry some milk to a
      neighbor who takes it of us. She usually sends for it, but her son is just
      now sick with the measles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet I think you cannot fail to enjoy the pleasant morning, even if you
      are here for other purposes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do enjoy it very much,&rdquo; said Frank. &ldquo;When I read of beautiful scenery
      in other countries, I always wish that I could visit them, and see for
      myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you will some day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frank smiled, and shook his head incredulously. &ldquo;I am afraid there is not
      much chance of it,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I thought when I was of your age,&rdquo; returned Henry Morton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you have traveled?&rdquo; said Frank, looking interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I have visited most of the countries of Europe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you been in Rome?&rdquo; inquired Frank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Are you interested in Rome?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who could help it, sir? I should like to see the Capitol, and the Via
      Sacra, and the Tarpeian Rock, and the Forum&mdash;and, in fact, Rome must
      be full of objects of interest. Who knows but I might tread where Cicero,
      and Virgil, and Caesar had trodden before me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Henry Morton looked at the boy who stood beside him with increased
      interest. &ldquo;I see you are quite a scholar,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Where did you learn
      about all these men and places?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have partly prepared for college,&rdquo; answered Frank; &ldquo;but my father went
      to the war some weeks since, and I am staying at home to take charge of
      the farm, and supply his place as well as I can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must have been quite a sacrifice to you to give up your studies?&rdquo; said
      his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, it was a great sacrifice; but we must all of us sacrifice
      something in these times. Even the boys can do something for their
      country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo; asked Henry Morton, more and more pleased with his
      chance acquaintance. &ldquo;I should like to become better acquainted with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frank blushed, and his expressive face showed that he was gratified by the
      compliment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name is Frank Frost,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;and I live about half a mile from
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I am Henry Morton. I am stopping temporarily at the hotel. Shall you
      be at leisure this evening, Frank?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I should be glad to receive a call from you. I have no
      acquaintances, and perhaps we may help each other to make the evening pass
      pleasantly. I have some pictures collected abroad, which I think you might
      like to look at.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be delighted to come,&rdquo; said Frank, his eyes sparkling with
      pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time they had reached the church, which was distant but a few rods
      from the hotel. They had just turned the corner of the road, when the
      clang of a bell was heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose that is my breakfast-bell,&rdquo; said the young man. &ldquo;It finds me
      with a good appetite. Good morning, Frank. I will expect you, then, this
      evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frank returned home, feeling quite pleased with his invitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish,&rdquo; thought he, &ldquo;that I might see considerable of Mr. Morton. I
      could learn a great deal from him, he has seen so much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His road led him past the house of Squire Haynes. John was sauntering
      about the yard with his hands in his pockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning, John,&rdquo; said Frank, in a pleasant voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      John did not seem inclined to respond to this politeness. On seeing Frank
      he scowled, and without deigning to make a reply turned his back and went
      into the house. He had not forgotten the last occasion on which they had
      met in the woods, when Frank defeated his cruel designs upon poor Pomp.
      There was not much likelihood that he would forget it very soon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't understand John,&rdquo; thought Frank. &ldquo;The other boys will get mad and
      get over it before the next day; John broods over it for weeks. I really
      believe he hates me. But, of course, I couldn't act any differently. I
      wasn't going to stand by and see Pomp beaten. I should do just the same
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The day wore away, and in the evening Frank presented himself at the
      hotel, and inquired for Mr. Morton. He was ushered upstairs, and told to
      knock at the door of a room in the second story.
    </p>
    <p>
      His knock was answered by the young man in person, who shook his hand with
      a pleasant smile, and invited him in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad to see you, Frank,&rdquo; he said, very cordially.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I am much obliged to you for inviting me, Mr. Morton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They sat down together beside the table, and conversed on a variety of
      topics. Frank had numberless questions to ask about foreign scenes and
      countries, all of which were answered with the utmost readiness. Henry
      Morton brought out a large portfolio containing various pictures, some on
      note-paper, representing scenes in different parts of Europe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The evening wore away only too rapidly for Frank. He had seldom passed two
      hours so pleasantly. At half-past nine, he rose, and said
      half-regretfully, &ldquo;I wish you were going to live in the village this
      winter, Mr. Morton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man smiled. &ldquo;Such is my intention, Frank,&rdquo; he said quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall you stay?&rdquo; said Frank joyfully. &ldquo;I suppose you will board here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should prefer a quieter boarding-place. Can you recommend one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frank hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where,&rdquo; continued Mr. Morton, &ldquo;I could enjoy the companionship of an
      intelligent young gentleman of your age?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we lived nearer the village,&rdquo; Frank began, and stopped abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Half a mile would be no objection to me. As I don't think you will find
      it unpleasant, Frank, I will authorize you to offer your mother five
      dollars a week for a room and a seat at her table.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am quite sure she would be willing, Mr. Morton, but I am afraid we
      should not live well enough to suit you. And I don't think you ought to
      pay so much as five dollars a week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave that to me, Frank. My main object is to obtain a pleasant home; and
      that I am sure I should find at your house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, sir,&rdquo; said Frank; &ldquo;I will mention it to my mother, and let you
      know in the course of to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII. A SHADE OF MYSTERY
    </h2>
    <p>
      Frank found little difficulty in persuading his mother to accept young
      Morton's proposition. From her son's description she felt little doubt
      that he would be a pleasant addition to the family circle, while his fund
      of information would make him instructive as well as agreeable.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was another consideration besides which determined her to take him.
      Five dollars a week would go a great way in housekeeping, or, rather, as
      their income from other sources would probably be sufficient for this, she
      could lay aside the entire amount toward paying the mortgage held by
      Squire Haynes. This plan occurred simultaneously to Frank and his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should certainly feel myself to blame if I neglected so good an
      opportunity of helping your father,&rdquo; said Mrs. Frost.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose we don't tell him, mother,&rdquo; suggested Frank; &ldquo;but when he gets
      home surprise him with the amount of our savings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Mrs. Frost, after a moment's thought, &ldquo;your father will be all
      the better for all the good news we can send him. It will make his life
      more tolerable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frank harnessed his horse to a light wagon and drove down to the tavern.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry Morton was sitting on the piazza, as the day was unusually-warm,
      with a book in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, looking up with a smile, &ldquo;I hope you have come for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is my errand, Mr. Morton,&rdquo; answered Frank. &ldquo;If your trunk is already
      packed, we will take it along with us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is quite ready. If you will come up and help me downstairs with it, I
      will settle with the landlord and leave at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was speedily arranged, and the young man soon occupied a seat beside
      Frank.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrived at the farmhouse, Frank introduced the new boarder to his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope we shall be able to make you comfortable,&rdquo; said Mrs. Frost, in a
      hospitable tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I entertain no doubt of it,&rdquo; he said politely. &ldquo;I am easy to suit, and I
      foresee that Frank and I will become intimate friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was very urgent to have you come. I am not quite sure whether it would
      have been safe for me to refuse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope he will be as urgent to have me stay. That will be a still higher
      compliment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is the room you are to occupy, Mr. Morton,&rdquo; said Mrs. Frost, opening
      a door at the head of the front stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a large square room, occupying the front eastern corner of the
      house. The furniture was neat and comfortable, though not pretentious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like this,&rdquo; said the young man, surveying his new quarters with an air
      of satisfaction. &ldquo;The sun will find me out in the morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it will remain with you through the forenoon. I think you will find
      the room warm and comfortable. But whenever you get tired of it you will
      be welcome downstairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is an invitation of which I shall be only too glad to avail myself.
      Now, Frank, if you will be kind enough to help me upstairs with my trunk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The trunk was carried up between them, and placed in a closet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will send for a variety of articles from the city to make my room look
      social and cheerful,&rdquo; said Mr. Morton. &ldquo;I have some books and engravings
      in Boston, which I think will contribute to make it so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A day or two later, two large boxes arrived, one containing pictures, the
      other books. Of the latter there were perhaps a hundred and fifty, choice
      and well selected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank looked at them with avidity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall be welcome to use them as freely as you like,&rdquo; said the owner&mdash;an
      offer which Frank gratefully accepted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The engravings were tastefully framed in black walnut. One represented one
      of Raphael's Madonnas. Another was a fine photograph, representing a
      palace in Venice. Several others portrayed foreign scenes. Among them was
      a street scene in Rome. An entire family were sitting in different
      postures on the portico of a fine building, the man with his swarthy
      features half-concealed under a slouch hat, the woman holding a child in
      her lap, while another, a boy with large black eyes, leaned his head upon
      her knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That represents a Roman family at home,&rdquo; explained Henry Morton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At home!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is the only home they have. They sleep wherever night finds them,
      sheltering themselves from the weather as well as they can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how do they get through the winter? should think they would freeze.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nature has bestowed upon Italy a mild climate, so that, although they may
      find the exposure at this season disagreeable, they are in no danger of
      freezing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was another engraving which Frank looked at curiously. It
      represented a wagon laden with casks of wine, and drawn by an ox and a
      donkey yoked together. Underneath was a descriptive phrase, &ldquo;Caro di
      vino.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't see such teams in this country,&rdquo; said Mr. Morton, smiling. &ldquo;In
      Italy they are common enough. In the background you notice a priest with a
      shovel-hat, sitting sideways on a donkey. Such a sight is much more common
      there than that of a man on horseback. Indeed, this stubborn animal is
      found very useful in ascending and descending mountains, being much
      surer-footed than the horse. I have ridden down steep descents along the
      verge of a precipice where it would have been madness to venture on
      horseback, but I felt the strongest confidence in the donkey I bestrode.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frank noticed a few Latin books in the collection. &ldquo;Do you read Latin, Mr.
      Morton?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, with tolerable ease. If I can be of any assistance to you in
      carrying on your Latin studies, it will afford me pleasure to do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very much obliged to you, Mr. Morton. I tried to go on with it by
      myself, but every now and then I came to a difficult sentence which I
      could not make out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think we can overcome the difficulties between us. At any rate, we will
      try. Have no hesitation in applying to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before closing this chapter, I think it necessary to narrate a little
      incident which served to heighten the interest with which Frank regarded
      his new friend, though it involved the latter in a shadow of mystery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Frost did not keep what in New England is denominated &ldquo;help.&rdquo; Being
      in good health, she performed the greater part of her household tasks
      unassisted. When washing and house-cleaning days came, however, she
      obtained outside assistance. For this purpose she engaged Chloe to come
      twice a week, on Monday and Saturday, not only because in this way she
      could help the woman to earn a living, but also because she found her a
      valuable and efficient assistant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry Morton became a member of the little household at the farm on
      Thursday, and two days later Chloe came as usual to &ldquo;clean house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man was standing in the front yard as Chloe, with a white turban
      on her head, for she had not yet laid aside her Southern mode of dress,
      came from the street by a little path which led to the back door. Her
      attention was naturally drawn to the young man. No sooner did she obtain a
      full view of him, than she stopped short and exclaimed with every
      appearance of surprise, &ldquo;Why, Mass' Richard, who'd'a' thought to see you
      here. You look just like you used to do, dat's a fac'. It does my old eyes
      good to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Henry Morton turned suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, Chloe!&rdquo; he exclaimed in equal surprise. &ldquo;What brings you up here? I
      thought you were miles away, in Virginia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I was, Mass' Richard. But Lor' bless you, when de Linkum sogers come,
      I couldn't stay no longer. I took and runned away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And here you are, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Mass' Richard, here I is, for sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you like the North, Chloe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't like it as well as de Souf. It's too cold,&rdquo; and Chloe shivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you would rather be here than there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Mass' Richard. Here I own myself. Don't have no oberseer to crack
      his whip at me now. I'se a free woman now, and so's my little Pomp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man smiled at the innocent mistake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pomp is your little boy, I suppose, Chloe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Mass' Richard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he a good boy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's as sassy as de debble,&rdquo; said Chloe emphatically. &ldquo;I don't know
      what's goin' to 'come of dat boy. He's most worried my life out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he'll grow better as he grows older. Don't trouble yourself about
      him. But, Chloe, there's one favor I am going to ask of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Mass' Richard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't call me by my real name. For some reasons, which I can't at present
      explain, I prefer to be known as Henry Morton, for some months to come. Do
      you think you can remember to call me by that name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Mass'&mdash;Henry,&rdquo; said Chloe, looking perplexed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry Morton turned round to meet the surprised looks of Frank and his
      mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friends,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I hope you will not feel distrustful of me, when I
      freely acknowledge to you that imperative reasons compel me for a time to
      appear under a name not my own. Chloe and I are old acquaintances, but I
      must request her to keep secret for a time her past knowledge concerning
      me. I think,&rdquo; he added with a smile, &ldquo;that she would have nothing to say
      that would damage me. Some time you shall know all. Are you satisfied?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so,&rdquo; said Mrs. Frost. &ldquo;I have no doubt you have good and sufficient
      reason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will endeavor to justify your confidence,&rdquo; said Henry Morton, an
      expression of pleasure lighting up his face.

      CHAPTER XVIII. THANKSGIVING AT THE FARM
    </h2>
    <p>
      The chill November days drew to a close. The shrill winds whistled through
      the branches of the trees, and stirred the leaves which lay in brown heaps
      upon the ground. But at the end of the month came Thanksgiving&mdash;the
      farmer's Harvest Home. The fruits of the field were in abundance but in
      many a home there were vacant chairs, never more, alas! to be filled. But
      he who dies in a noble cause leaves sweet and fragrant memories behind,
      which shall ever after make it pleasant to think of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thanksgiving morning dawned foggy and cold. Yet there is something in the
      name that warms the heart and makes the dullest day seem bright. The
      sunshine of the heart more than compensates for the absence of sunshine
      without.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank had not been idle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night before he helped Jacob kill a turkey and a pair of chickens, and
      seated on a box in the barn they had picked them clean in preparation for
      the morrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within the house, too, might be heard the notes of busy preparation.
      Alice, sitting in a low chair, was busily engaged in chopping meat for
      mince pies. Maggie sat near her paring pumpkins, for a genuine New England
      Thanksgiving cannot be properly celebrated without pumpkin pies. Even
      little Charlie found work to do in slicing apples.
    </p>
    <p>
      By evening a long row of pies might be seen upon the kitchen dresser.
      Brown and flaky they looked, fit for the table of a prince. So the
      children thought as they surveyed the attractive array, and felt that
      Thanksgiving, come as often as it might, could never be unwelcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the forenoon of Thanksgiving day the preparations continued. Frank
      and Mr. Morton went to the village church, where an appropriate service
      was held by Reverend Mr. Apthorp. There were but few of the village
      matrons present. They were mostly detained at home by housewifely cares,
      which on that day could not well be delegated to other hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Morton,&rdquo; said Frank, as they walked leisurely home, &ldquo;did you notice
      how Squire Haynes stared at you this morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Morton looked interested. &ldquo;Did he?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I did not notice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he turned halfround, and looked at you with a puzzled expression, as
      if he thought he had seen you somewhere before, but could not recall who
      you were.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I reminded him of some one he has known in past years,&rdquo; said the
      young man quietly. &ldquo;We sometimes find strange resemblances in utter
      strangers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think he must have felt quite interested,&rdquo; pursued Frank, &ldquo;for he
      stopped me after church, and inquired who you were.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; said Henry Morton quietly. &ldquo;And what did you tell him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told him your name, and mentioned that you were boarding with us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What then? Did he make any further inquiries?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He asked where you came from.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He seemed quite curious about me. I ought to feel flattered. And what did
      you reply?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told him I did not know&mdash;that I only knew that part of your life
      had been passed in Europe. I heard him say under his breath, 'It is
      singular.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frank,&rdquo; said Mr. Morton, after a moment's thought, &ldquo;I wish to have Squire
      Haynes learn as little of me as possible. If, therefore, he should ask you
      how I am employed, you say that I have come here for the benefit of my
      health. This is one of my motives, though not the principal one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will remember,&rdquo; said Frank. &ldquo;I don't think he will say much to me,
      however. He has a grudge against father, and his son does not like me. I
      am sorry that father is compelled to have some business relations with the
      squire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he holds a mortgage on our farm for eight hundred dollars. It was
      originally more, but it has been reduced to this. He will have the right
      to foreclose on the first of July.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall you have the money ready for him at that time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; we may have half enough, perhaps. I am sometimes troubled when I
      think of it. Father feels confident, however, that the squire will not be
      hard upon us, but will renew the mortgage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Henry Morton looked very thoughtful, but said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had now reached the farmhouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dinner was already on the table. In the center, on a large dish, was the
      turkey, done to a turn. It was flanked by the chickens on a smaller dish.
      These were supported by various vegetables, such as the season supplied. A
      dish of cranberry sauce stood at one end of the table, and at the opposite
      end a dish of apple sauce.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think you can carve the turkey, Mr. Morton?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Frost.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will at least make the attempt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want the wish-bone, Mr. Morton,&rdquo; said Maggie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I want it,&rdquo; said Charlie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall both have one,&rdquo; said the mother. &ldquo;Luckily each of the chickens
      is provided with one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know what I am going to wish,&rdquo; said Charlie, nodding his head with
      decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Charlie, what is it?&rdquo; asked Frank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall wish that papa may come home safe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so will I,&rdquo; said Maggie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish he might sit down with us to-day,&rdquo; said Mrs. Frost, with a little
      sigh. &ldquo;He has never before been absent from us on Thanksgiving day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was he well when you last heard from him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but hourly expecting orders to march to join the army in Maryland. I
      am afraid he won't get as good a Thanksgiving dinner as this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two years ago,&rdquo; said Mr. Morton, &ldquo;I ate my Thanksgiving dinner in
      Amsterdam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do they have Thanksgiving there, Mr. Morton?&rdquo; inquired Alice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, they know nothing of our good New England festival. I was obliged to
      order a special dinner for myself. I don't think you would have recognized
      plum pudding under the name which they gave it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was it?&rdquo; asked Frank curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blom buden was the name given on the bill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can spell better than that,&rdquo; said Charlie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall have to send you out among the Dutchmen as a schoolmaster
      plenipotentiary,&rdquo; said Frank, laughing. &ldquo;I hope the 'blom buden' was good
      in spite of the way it was spelt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it was very good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't believe it beat mother's,&rdquo; said Charlie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At your present rate of progress, Charlie, you won't leave room for any,&rdquo;
       said Frank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I had two stomachs,&rdquo; said Charlie, looking regretfully at the
      inviting delicacies which tempted him with what the French call the
      embarrassment of riches.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well done, Charlie!&rdquo; laughed his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dinner was at length over. Havoc and desolation reigned upon the once
      well-filled table.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening, as they all sat together round the table, Maggie climbed
      on Mr. Morton's knee and petitioned for a story.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shall it be about?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me think a moment,&rdquo; said the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bent his eyes thoughtfully upon the wood-fire that crackled in the
      wide-open fireplace, and soon signified that he was ready to begin.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the children gathered around him, and even Mrs. Frost, sitting quietly
      at her knitting, edged her chair a little nearer, that she, too, might
      listen to Mr. Morton's story. As this was of some length, we shall devote
      to it a separate chapter.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIX. THE WONDERFUL TRANSFORMATION
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My story,&rdquo; commenced Mr. Morton, &ldquo;is rather a remarkable one in some
      respects; and I cannot vouch for its being true. I shall call it 'The
      Wonderful Transformation.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thomas Tubbs was a prosperous little tailor, and for forty years had been
      a resident of the town of Webbington, where he had been born and brought
      up. I have called him little, and you will agree with me when I say that,
      even in high-heeled boots, which he always wore, he measured only four
      feet and a half in height.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In spite, however, of his undersize, Thomas had succeeded in winning the
      hand of a woman fifteen inches taller than himself. If this extra height
      had been divided equally between them, possibly they might have attracted
      less observation. As it was, when they walked to church, the top of the
      little tailor's beaver just about reached the shoulders of Mrs. Tubbs.
      Nevertheless, they managed to live very happily together, for the most
      part, though now and then, when Thomas was a little refractory, his better
      half would snatch him up bodily, and, carrying him to the cellar, lock him
      up there. Such little incidents only served to spice their domestic life,
      and were usually followed by a warm reconciliation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The happy pair had six children, all of whom took after their mother, and
      promised to be tall; the oldest boy, twelve years of age, being already
      taller than his father, or, rather, he would have been but for the tall
      hat and high-heeled boots.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Tubbs was a tailor, as I have said. One day there came into his shop
      a man attired with extreme shabbiness. Thomas eyed him askance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Mr. Tubbs,' said the stranger, 'as you perceive, I am out at the elbows.
      I would like to get you to make me up a suit of clothes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Ahem!' coughed Thomas, and glanced upward at a notice affixed to the
      door, 'Terms, Cash.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The stranger's eye followed the direction of Mr. Tubbs'. He smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I frankly confess,' he said, 'that I shall not be able to pay
      immediately, but, if I live, I will pay you within six months.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'How am I to feel sure of that?' asked the tailor, hesitating.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I pledge my word,' was the reply. 'You see, Mr. Tubbs, I have been sick
      for some time past, and that, of course, has used up my money. Now, thank
      Providence, I am well again, and ready to go to work. But I need clothes,
      as you see, before I have the ability to pay for them.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'What's your name?' asked Thomas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Oswald Rudenheimer,' was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'A foreigner?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'As you may suppose. Now, Mr. Tubbs, what do you say? Do you think you
      can trust me?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thomas examined the face of his visitor. He looked honest, and the little
      tailor had a good deal of confidence in the excellence of human nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I may be foolish,' he said at last, 'but I'll do it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'A thousand thanks!' said the stranger. 'You sha'n't repent of it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The cloth was selected, and Thomas set to work. In three days the suit
      was finished, and Thomas sat in his shop waiting for his customer. At last
      he came, but what a change! He was splendidly dressed. The little tailor
      hardly recognized him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Mr. Tubbs,' said he, 'you're an honest man and a good fellow. You
      trusted me when I appeared penniless, but I deceived you. I am really one
      of the genii, of whom, perhaps, you have read, and lineally descended from
      those who guarded Solomon's seal. Instead of making you wait for your pay,
      I will recompense you on the spot, either in money or&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Or what? asked the astonished tailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Or I will grant the first wish that may be formed in your mind. Now
      choose.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thomas did not take long to choose. His charge would amount to but a few
      dollars, while he might wish for a million. He signified his decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Perhaps you have chosen wisely,' said his visitor. 'But mind that you
      are careful about your wish. You may wish for something you don't want.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'No fear of that,' said the tailor cheerfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'At any rate, I will come this way six months hence, and should you then
      wish to be released from the consequences of your wish, and to receive
      instead the money stipulated as the price of the suit, I will give you the
      chance.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, Thomas did not object, though he considered it rather a
      foolish proposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His visitor disappeared, and the tailor was left alone. He laid aside his
      work. How could a man be expected to work who had only to wish, and he
      could come into possession of more than he could earn in a hundred or even
      a thousand years?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I might as well enjoy myself a little,' thought Mr. Tubbs. 'Let me see.
      I think there is a show in the village to-day. I'll go to it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He accordingly slipped on his hat and went out, somewhat to the surprise
      of his wife, who concluded that her husband must be going out on business.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thomas Tubbs wended his way to the marketplace. He pressed in among the
      people, a crowd of whom had already assembled to witness the show. I
      cannot tell you what the show was. I am only concerned in telling you what
      Thomas Tubbs saw and did; and, to tell the plain truth, he didn't see
      anything at all. He was wedged in among people a foot or two taller than
      himself. Now, it is not pleasant to hear all about you laughing heartily
      and not even catch a glimpse of what amuses them so much. Thomas Tubbs was
      human, and as curious as most people. Just as a six-footer squeezed in
      front of him he could not help framing, in his vexation, this wish:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Oh, dear! I wish I were ten feet high!'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Luckless Thomas Tubbs! Never had he framed a more unfortunate wish. On
      the instant he shot up from an altitude of four feet six to ten feet.
      Fortunately his clothes expanded proportionally. So, instead of being
      below the medium height, he was raised more than four feet above it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, his immediate neighbors became aware of the gigantic presence,
      though they did not at all recognize its identity with the little tailor,
      Thomas Tubbs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At once there was a shout of terror. The crowd scattered in all
      directions, forgetting the spectacle at which, the moment before, they had
      been laughing heartily, and the little tailor, no longer little, was left
      alone in the market-place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Good heavens!' he exclaimed in bewilderment, stretching out his brawny
      arm, nearly five feet in length, and staring at it in ludicrous
      astonishment, 'who'd have thought that I should ever be so tall?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To tell the truth, the little man&mdash;I mean Mr. Tubbs&mdash;at first
      rather enjoyed his new magnitude. He had experienced mortification so long
      on account of his diminutive stature, that he felt a little exhilarated at
      the idea of being able to look down on those to whom he had hitherto felt
      compelled to look up. It was rather awkward to have people afraid of him.
      As he turned to leave the square, for the exhibitor of the show had run
      off in the general panic, he could see people looking at him from
      third-story windows, and pointing at him with outstretched fingers and
      mouths agape.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Really,' thought Thomas Tubbs, 'I never expected to be such an object of
      interest. I think I'll go home.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His house was a mile off, but so large were his strides that five minutes
      carried him to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now Mrs. Tubbs was busy putting the dinner on the table, and wondering
      why her husband did not make his appearance. She was fully determined to
      give him a scolding in case his delay was so great as to cause the dinner
      to cool. All at once she heard a bustle at the door. Looking into the
      entry, she saw a huge man endeavoring to make his entrance into the house.
      As the portal was only seven feet in height, it was not accomplished
      without a great deal of twisting and squirming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Tubbs turned pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'What are you trying to do, you monster?' she faltered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I have come home to dinner, Mary,' was the meek reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Come home to dinner!' exclaimed Mrs. Tubbs, aghast. 'Who in the name of
      wonder are you, you overgrown brute?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Who am I? asked the giant, smiling feebly, for he began to feel a little
      queer at this reception from the wife with whom he had lived for fifteen
      years. 'Ha! ha! don't you know your own husband&mdash;your Tommy?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'My husband!' exclaimed Mrs. Tubbs, astonished at the fellow's impudence.
      'You, don't mean to say that you are my husband?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Of course I am,' said Thomas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Then,' said Mrs. Tubbs, 'I would have you know that my husband is a
      respectable little man, not half your size.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Oh, dear!' thought Thomas. 'Well, here's a kettle of fish; my own wife
      won't own me!'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'So I was,' he said aloud. 'I was only four feet six; but I've&mdash;I've
      grown.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Grown!' Mrs. Tubbs laughed hysterically. 'That's a likely story, when
      it's only an hour since my husband went into the street as short as ever.
      I only wish he'd come in, I do, to expose your imposition.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'But I have grown, Mary,' said Tubbs piteously. 'I was out in the crowd,
      and I couldn't see what was going on, and so I wished I was ten feet high;
      and, before I knew it, I was as tall as I am now.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'No doubt,' said Mrs. Tubbs incredulously, 'As to that, all I've got to
      say is, that you'd better wish yourself back again, as I sha'n't own you
      as my husband till you do!'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Really,' thought Mr. Tubbs, 'this is dreadful! What can I do!'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just then one of his children ran into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Johnny, come to me,' said his father imploringly. 'Come to your father.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'My father!' said Johnny, shying out of the room. 'You ain't my father.
      My father isn't as tall as a tree.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'You see how absurd your claim is,' said Mrs. Tubbs. 'You'll oblige me by
      leaving the house directly.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Leave the house&mdash;my house!' said Tubbs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'If you don't, I'll call in the neighbors,' said the courageous woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I don't believe they'd dare to come,' said Tubbs, smiling queerly at the
      recollection of what a sensation his appearance had made.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Won't you go?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'At least you'll let me have some dinner. I am 'most famished.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Dinner!&rdquo; said Mrs. Tubbs, hesitating. 'I don't think there's enough in
      the house. However, you can sit down to the table.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tubbs attempted to sit down on a chair, but his weight was so great that
      it was crushed beneath him. Finally, he was compelled to sit on the floor,
      and even then his stature was such that his head rose to the height of six
      feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What an enormous appetite he had, too! The viands on the table seemed
      nothing. He at first supplied his plate with the usual quantity; but as
      the extent of his appetite became revealed to him, he was forced to make
      away with everything on the table. Even then he was hungry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Well, I declare,' thought Mrs. Tubbs, in amazement, 'it does take an
      immense quantity to keep him alive!'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tubbs rose from the table, and, in doing so, hit his head a smart whack
      against the ceiling. Before leaving the house he turned to make a last
      appeal to his wife, who, he could not help seeing, was anxious to have him
      go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Won't you own me, Mary?' he asked. 'It isn't my fault that I am so big.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Own you!' exclaimed his wife. 'I wouldn't own you for a mint of money.
      You'd eat me out of house and home in less than a week.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I don't know but I should,' said Mr. Tubbs mournfully. 'I don't see what
      gives me such an appetite. I'm hungry now.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Hungry, after you've eaten enough for six!' exclaimed his wife, aghast.
      'Well, I never!'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Then you won't let me stay, Mary?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'No, no.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With slow and sad strides Thomas Tubbs left the house. The world seemed
      dark enough to the poor fellow. Not only was he disowned by his wife and
      children, but he could not tell how he should ever earn enough to keep him
      alive, with the frightful appetite which he now possessed. 'I don't know,'
      he thought, 'but the best way is to drown myself at once.' So he walked to
      the river, but found it was not deep enough to drown him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As he emerged from the river uncomfortably wet, he saw a man timidly
      approaching him. It proved to be the manager of the show.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Hello!' said he hesitatingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Hello!' returned Tubbs disconsolately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Would you like to enter into a business engagement with me?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Of what sort?' asked Tubbs, brightening up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'To be exhibited,' was the reply. 'You're the largest man living in the
      world. We could make a pretty penny together.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tubbs was glad enough to accept this proposition, which came to him like
      a plank to a drowning man. Accordingly an agreement was made that, after
      deducting expenses, he should share profits with the manager.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It proved to be a great success. From all quarters people flocked to see
      the great prodigy, the wonder of the world, as he was described in huge
      posters. Scientific men wrote learned papers in which they strove to
      explain his extraordinary height, and, as might be expected, no two
      assigned the same cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the end of six months Tubbs had five thousand dollars as his share of
      the profits. But after all he was far from happy. He missed the society of
      his wife and children, and shed many tears over his separation from them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the end of six months his singular customer again made his appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'It seems to me you've altered some since I last saw you,' he said, with
      a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Yes,' said Tubbs dolefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'You don't like the change, I judge?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'No,' said Tubbs. 'It separates me from my wife and children, and that
      makes me unhappy.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Would you like to be changed back again!'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Gladly,' was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Presto! the wonderful giant was changed back into the little tailor. No
      sooner was this effected than he returned post-haste to Webbington. His
      wife received him with open arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Oh, Thomas,' she exclaimed, 'how could you leave us so? On the day of
      your disappearance a huge brute of a man came here and pretended to be
      you, but I soon sent him away.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thomas wisely said nothing, but displayed his five thousand dollars.
      There was great joy in the little dwelling. Thomas Tubbs at once took a
      larger shop, and grew every year in wealth and public esteem. The only way
      in which he did not grow was in stature; but his six months' experience as
      a giant had cured him of any wish of that sort. The last I heard of him
      was his election to the legislature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a bully story,&rdquo; said Charlie, using a word which he had heard from
      older boys. &ldquo;I wish I was a great tall giant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would you do if you were, Charlie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd go and fight the rebels,&rdquo; said Charlie manfully.

      CHAPTER XX. POMP'S EDUCATION COMMENCES
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the season of leisure from farm work which followed, Frank found
      considerable time for study. The kind sympathy and ready assistance given
      by Mr. Morton made his task a very agreeable one, and his progress for a
      time was as rapid as if he had remained at school.
    </p>
    <p>
      He also assumed the office of teacher, having undertaken to give a little
      elementary instruction to Pomp. Here his task was beset with difficulties.
      Pomp was naturally bright, but incorrigibly idle. His activity was all
      misdirected and led him into a wide variety of mischief. He had been sent
      to school, but his mischievous propensities had so infected the boys
      sitting near him that the teacher had been compelled to request his
      removal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three times in the week, during the afternoon, Pomp came over to the farm
      for instruction. On the first of these occasions we will look in upon him
      and his teacher.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pomp is sitting on a cricket by the kitchen fire. He has a primer open
      before him at the alphabet. His round eyes are fixed upon the page as long
      as Frank is looking at him, but he requires constant watching. His teacher
      sits near-by, with a Latin dictionary resting upon a light stand before
      him, and a copy of Virgil's Aeneid in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Pomp, do you think you know your lesson?&rdquo; he asks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dunno, Mass' Frank; I reckon so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may bring your book to me, and I will try you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pomp rose from his stool and sidled up to Frank with no great alacrity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's that letter, Pomp?&rdquo; asked the young teacher, pointing out the
      initial letter of the alphabet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pomp answered correctly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what is the next?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pomp shifted from one foot to the other, and stared vacantly out of the
      window, but said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Pears like I don't 'member him, Mass' Frank.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here Frank had recourse to a system of mnemonics frequently resorted to by
      teachers in their extremity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the name of the little insect that stings people sometimes, Pomp?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wasp, Mass' Frank,&rdquo; was the confident reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don't mean that. I mean the bee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Mass' Frank.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, this is B.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pomp looked at it attentively, and, after a pause, inquired, &ldquo;Where's him
      wings, Mass' Frank?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frank bit his lips to keep from laughing. &ldquo;I don't mean that this is a bee
      that makes honey,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;only it has the same name. Now do you
      think you can remember how it is called?&rdquo; &ldquo;Bumblebee!&rdquo; repeated Pomp
      triumphantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pomp's error was corrected, and the lesson proceeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the next letter?&rdquo; asked Frank, indicating it with the point of
      his knife-blade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;X,&rdquo; answered the pupil readily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Pomp,&rdquo; was the dismayed reply. &ldquo;It is very different from X.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dat's him name at school,&rdquo; said Pomp positively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Pomp, you are mistaken. That is X, away down there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps him change his name,&rdquo; suggested Pomp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. The letters never change their names. I don't think you know your
      lesson, Pomp. just listen to me while I tell you the names of some of the
      letters, and try to remember them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When this was done, Pomp was directed to sit down on the cricket, and
      study his lesson for twenty Minutes, at the end of which he might again
      recite.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pomp sat down, and for five minutes seemed absorbed in his book. Then,
      unfortunately, the cat walked into the room, and soon attracted the
      attention of the young student. He sidled from his seat so silently that
      Frank did not hear him. He was soon made sensible that Pomp was engaged in
      some mischief by hearing a prolonged wail of anguish from the cat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking up, he found that his promising pupil had tied her by the leg to a
      chair, and under these circumstances was amusing himself by pinching her
      tail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you doing there, Pomp?&rdquo; he asked quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pomp scuttled back to his seat, and appeared to be deeply intent upon his
      primer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ain't doin' noffin', Mass' Frank,&rdquo; he answered innocently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then how came the cat tied to that chair?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Spec' she must have tied herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Pomp, you know better than that. You know cats can't tie
      themselves. Get up immediately and unfasten her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pomp rose with alacrity, and undertook to release puss from the thraldom
      of which she had become very impatient. Perhaps she would have been quite
      as well off if she had been left to herself. The process of liberation did
      not appear to be very agreeable, judging from the angry mews which
      proceeded from her. Finally, in her indignation against Pomp for some
      aggressive act, she scratched him sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wicked old debble!&rdquo; exclaimed Pomp wrathfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      He kicked at the cat; but she was lucky enough to escape, and ran out of
      the room as fast as her four legs could carry her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Big ugly debble!&rdquo; muttered Pomp, watching the blood ooze from his finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter, Pomp?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old cat scratch me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what did you do to her, Pomp? I am afraid you deserved your scratch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't do noffin', Mass' Frank,&rdquo; said Pomp virtuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think you always tell the truth, Pomp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't help it, Mass' Frank. 'Spec' I've got a little debble inside of
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean, Pomp! What put that idea in your head?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dat's what mammy says. Dat's what she al'ays tells me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Frank, &ldquo;I think it will be best to whip it out of you.
      Where's my stick?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, Mass' Frank,&rdquo; said Pomp, in alarm; &ldquo;I'll be good, for sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then sit down and get your lesson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Pomp assumed his cricket. Before he had time to devise any new
      mischief, Mrs. Frost came to the head of the stairs and called Frank.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank laid aside his books, and presented himself at the foot of the
      stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like your help a few minutes. Can you leave your studies?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before going up, he cautioned Pomp to study quietly, and not get into any
      mischief while he was gone. Pomp promised very readily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank had hardly got upstairs before his pupil rose from the cricket, and
      began to look attentively about him. His first proceeding was to, hide his
      primer carefully in Mrs. Frost's work-basket, which lay on the table.
      Then, looking curiously about him, his attention was drawn to the
      old-fashioned clock that stood in the corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, Pomp's curiosity had been strongly excited by this clock. It was not
      quite clear to him how the striking part was effected. Here seemed to be a
      favorable opportunity for instituting an investigation. Pomp drew his
      cricket to, the clock, and, opening it, tried to reach up to the face. But
      he was not yet high enough. He tried a chair, and still required a greater
      elevation. Espying Frank's Latin dictionary, he pressed that into service.
    </p>
    <p>
      By and by Frank and his mother heard the clock striking an unusual number
      of times.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter with the clock?&rdquo; inquired Mrs. Frost.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; said Frank unsuspiciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has struck ten times, and it is only four o' clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if Pomp can have got at it,&rdquo; said Frank, with a sudden thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      He ran downstairs hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pomp heard him coming, and in his anxiety to escape detection, contrived
      to lose his balance and fall to the floor. As he fell, he struck the
      table, on which a pan of sour milk had been placed, and it was overturned,
      deluging poor Pomp with the unsavory fluid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pomp shrieked and kicked most energetically. His appearance, as he picked
      himself up, was ludicrous in the extreme. His sable face was plentifully
      besprinkled with clotted milk, giving him the appearance of a negro who is
      coming out white in spots. The floor was swimming in milk. Luckily the
      dictionary had fallen clear of it, and so escaped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this the way you study?&rdquo; demanded Frank, as sternly as his sense of
      the ludicrous plight in which he found Pomp would permit.
    </p>
    <p>
      For once Pomp's ready wit deserted him. He had nothing to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go out and wash yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pomp came back rather shamefaced, his face restored to its original color.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, where is your book?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pomp looked about him, but, as he took good care not to look where he knew
      his book to be, of course he did not find it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I 'clare, Mass' Frank, it done lost,&rdquo; he at length asserted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can it be lost when you had it only a few minutes ago?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dunno,&rdquo; answered Pomp stolidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you been out of the room?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pomp answered in the negative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it must be somewhere here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frank went quietly to the corner of the room and took therefrom a stick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Pomp,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I will give you just two minutes to find the book
      in. If you don't find it, I shall have to give you a whipping.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pomp looked at his teacher to see if he was in earnest. Seeing that he
      was, he judged it best to find the book.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking into the work-box, he said innocently: &ldquo;I 'clare to gracious,
      Mass' Frank, if it hasn't slipped down yere. Dat's mi'ty cur's, dat is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pomp, sit down,&rdquo; said Frank. &ldquo;I am going to talk to you seriously. What
      makes you tell so many lies?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dunno any better,&rdquo; replied Pomp, grinning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you do, Pomp. Doesn't your mother tell you not to lie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lor', Mass' Frank, she's poor ignorant nigger. She don't know nuffin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mustn't speak so of your mother. She brings you up as well as she
      knows how. She has to work hard for you, and you ought to love her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I do, 'cept when she licks me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you behave properly she won't whip you. You'll grow up a 'poor,
      ignorant nigger' yourself, if you don't study.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I get white, Mass' Frank, if I study?&rdquo; asked Pomp, showing a double
      row of white teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were white enough just now,&rdquo; said Frank, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yah, yah!&rdquo; returned Pomp, who appreciated the joke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Pomp,&rdquo; Frank continued seriously, &ldquo;if you will learn your lesson in
      fifteen minutes I will give you a piece of gingerbread.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll do it, Mass' Frank,&rdquo; said Pomp promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pomp was very fond of gingerbread, as Frank very well knew. In the time
      specified the lesson was got, and recited satisfactorily.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Pomp's education will not again be referred to, it may be said that
      when Frank had discovered how to manage him, he learned quite rapidly.
      Chloe, who was herself unable to read, began to look upon Pomp with a new
      feeling of respect when she found that he could read stories in words of
      one syllable, and the &ldquo;lickings&rdquo; of which he complained became less
      frequent. But his love of fun still remained, and occasionally got him
      into trouble, as we shall hereafter have occasion to see.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXI. THE BATTLE OF FREDERICKSBURG
    </h2>
    <p>
      About the middle of December came the sad tragedy of Fredericksburg, in
      which thousands of our gallant soldiers yielded up their lives in a hard,
      unequal struggle, which brought forth nothing but mortification and
      disaster.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first telegrams which appeared in the daily papers brought anxiety and
      bodings of ill to many households. The dwellers at the farm were not
      exempt. They had been apprised by a recent letter that Mr. Frost's
      regiment now formed a part of the grand army which lay encamped on the
      eastern side of the Rappahannock. The probability was that he was engaged
      in the battle. Frank realized for the first time to what peril his father
      was exposed, and mingled with the natural feeling which such a thought was
      likely to produce was the reflection that, but for him, his father would
      have been in safety at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I do right?&rdquo; Frank asked himself anxiously, the old doubt recurring
      once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, above the selfish thought of peril to him and his, rose the
      consideration of the country's need, and Frank said to himself, &ldquo;I have
      done right&mdash;whatever happens. I feel sure of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yet his anxiety was by no means diminished, especially when, a day or two
      afterward, tidings of the disaster came to hand, only redeemed by the
      masterly retreat across the river, in which a great army, without the loss
      of a single gun, ambulance, or wagon, withdrew from the scene of a
      hopeless struggle, under the very eyes of the enemy, yet escaping
      discovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      One afternoon Frank went to the post-office a little after the usual time.
      As he made his way through a group at the door, he notice compassionate
      glances directed toward him.
    </p>
    <p>
      His heart gave a sudden bound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has anything happened to my father?&rdquo; he inquired, with pale face. &ldquo;Have
      any of you heard anything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is wounded, Frank,&rdquo; said the nearest bystander.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Show it to me,&rdquo; said Frank.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening paper, which was placed in his hands, he read a single
      line, but of fearful import: &ldquo;Henry Frost, wounded.&rdquo; Whether the wound was
      slight or serious, no intimation was given.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank heaved a sigh of comparative relief. His father was not dead, as he
      at first feared. Yet he felt that the suspense would be a serious trial.
      He did not know how to tell his mother. She met him at the gate. His
      serious face and lagging steps revealed the truth, exciting at first
      apprehensions of something even more serious.
    </p>
    <p>
      For two days they remained without news. Then came a letter from the
      absent father, which wonderfully lightened all their hearts. The fact that
      he was able to write a long letter with his own hand showed plainly that
      his wound must be a trifling one. The letter ran thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DEAR MARY: I fear that the report of my wound will reach you before this
      letter comes to assure you that it is a mere scratch, and scarcely worth a
      thought. I cannot for an instant think of it, when I consider how many of
      our poor fellows have been mown down by instant death, or are now lying
      with ghastly wounds on pallets in the hospital. We have been through a
      fearful trial, and the worst thought is that our losses are not
      compensated by a single advantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before giving you an account of it from the point of view of a private
      soldier, let me set your mind at rest by saying that my injury is only a
      slight flesh-wound in the arm, which will necessitate my carrying it in a
      sling for a few days; that is all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Early on the morning of Thursday, the 10th inst., the first act in the
      great drama commenced with laying the pontoon bridges over which our men
      were to make their way into the rebel city. My own division was to cross
      directly opposite the city. All honor to the brave men who volunteered to
      lay the bridges. It was a trying and perilous duty. On the other side, in
      rifle-pits and houses at the brink of the river, were posted the enemy's
      sharpshooters, and these at a given signal opened fire upon our poor
      fellows who were necessarily unprotected. The firing was so severe and
      deadly, and impossible to escape from, that for the time we were obliged
      to desist. Before anything could be effected it became clear that the
      sharpshooters must be dislodged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then opened the second scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A deluge of shot and shell from our side of the river rained upon the
      city, setting some buildings on fire, and severely damaging others. It was
      a most exciting spectacle to us who watched from the bluffs, knowing that
      ere long we must make the perilous passage and confront the foe, the
      mysterious silence of whose batteries inspired alarm, as indicating a
      consciousness of power.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The time of our trial came at length.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Toward the close of the afternoon General Howard's division, to which I
      belong, crossed the pontoon bridge whose building had cost us more than
      one gallant soldier. The distance was short, for the Rappahannock at this
      point is not more than a quarter of a mile wide. In a few minutes we were
      marching through the streets of Fredericksburg. We gained possession of
      the lower streets, but not without some street fighting, in which our
      brigade lost about one hundred in killed and wounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the first time I witnessed violent death. The man marching by my side
      suddenly reeled, and, pressing his hand to his breast, fell forward. Only
      a moment before he had spoken to me, saying, 'I think we are going to have
      hot work.' Now he was dead, shot through the heart. I turned sick with
      horror, but there was no time to pause. We must march on, not knowing that
      our turn might not come next. Each of us felt that he bore his life in his
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this was soon over, and orders came that we should bivouac for the
      night. You will not wonder that I lay awake nearly the whole night. A
      night attack was possible, and the confusion and darkness would have made
      it fearful. As I lay awake I could not help thinking how anxious you would
      feel if you had known where I was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So closed the first day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The next dawned warm and pleasant. In the quiet of the morning it seemed
      hard to believe that we were on the eve of a bloody struggle. Discipline
      was not very strictly maintained. Some of our number left the ranks and
      ransacked the houses, more from curiosity than the desire to pillage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I went down to the bank of the river, and took a look at the bridge which
      it had cost us so much trouble to throw across. It bore frequent marks of
      the firing of the day previous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At one place I came across an old negro, whose white head and wrinkled
      face indicated an advanced age. Clinging to him were two children, of
      perhaps four and six years of age, who had been crying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Don't cry, honey,' I heard him say soothingly, wiping the tears from the
      cheeks of the youngest with a coarse cotton handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I want mama,' said the child piteously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A sad expression came over the old black's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'What is the matter?' I asked, advancing toward him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'She is crying for her mother,' he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Is she dead?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Yes, sir; she'd been ailing for a long time, and the guns of yesterday
      hastened her death.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Where did you live?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'In that house yonder, sir.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Didn't you feel afraid when we fired on the town?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'We were all in the cellar, sir. One shot struck the house, but did not
      injure it much.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'You use very good language,' I could not help saying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Yes, sir; I have had more advantages than most of&mdash;of my class.'
      These last words he spoke rather bitterly. 'When I was a young man my
      master amused himself with teaching me; but he found I learned so fast
      that he stopped short. But I carried it on by myself.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Didn't you find that difficult?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Yes, sir; but my will was strong. I managed to get books, now one way,
      now another. I have read considerable, sir.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This he said with some pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Have you ever read Shakespeare?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'In part, sir; but I never could get hold of &ldquo;Hamlet.&rdquo; I have always
      wanted to read that play.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I drew him out, and was astonished at the extent of his information, and
      the intelligent judgment which he expressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I wonder that, with your acquirements, you should have been content to
      remain in a state of slavery.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Content!' he repeated bitterly. 'Do you think I have been content? No,
      sir. Twice I attempted to escape. Each time I was caught, dragged back,
      and cruelly whipped. Then I was sold to the father of these little ones.
      He treated me so well, and I was getting so old, that I gave up the idea
      of running away.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'And where is he now?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'He became a colonel in the Confederate service, and was killed at
      Antietam. Yesterday my mistress died, as I have told you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'And are you left in sole charge of these little children?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Yes, sir.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Have they no relatives living?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Their uncle lives in Kentucky. I shall try to carry them there.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'But you will find it hard work. You have only to cross the river, and in
      our lines you will be no longer a slave.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I know it, sir. Three of my children have got their freedom, thank God,
      in that way. But I can't leave these children.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I looked down at them. They were beautiful children. The youngest was a
      girl, with small features, dark hair, and black eyes. The boy, of six, was
      pale and composed, and uttered no murmur. Both clung confidently to the
      old negro.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could not help admiring the old man, who could resist the prospect of
      freedom, though he had coveted it all his life, in order to remain loyal
      to his trust. I felt desirous of drawing him out on the subject of the
      war.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'What do you think of this war?' I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He lifted up his hand, and in a tone of solemnity, said, 'I think it is
      the cloud by day, and the pillar of fire by night, that's going to draw us
      out of our bondage into the Promised Land.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was struck by his answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Do many of you&mdash;I mean of those who have not enjoyed your
      advantages of education&mdash;think so?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Yes, sir; we think it is the Lord's doings, and it is marvelous in our
      eyes. It's a time of trial and of tribulation; but it isn't a-going to
      last. The children of Israel were forty years in the wilderness, and so it
      may be with us. The day of deliverance will come.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At this moment the little girl began again to cry, and he addressed
      himself to soothe her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This was not the only group I encountered. Some women had come, down to
      the river with children half-bereft of their senses&mdash;some apparently
      supposing that we should rob or murder them. The rebel leaders and
      newspapers have so persistently reiterated these assertions, that they
      have come to believe them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The third day was unusually lovely, but our hearts were too anxious to
      admit of our enjoying it. The rebels were entrenched on heights behind the
      town. It was necessary that these should be taken, and about noon the
      movement commenced. Our forces marched steadily across the intervening
      plain. The rebels reserved their fire till we were half-way across, and
      then from all sides burst forth the deadly fire. We were completely at
      their mercy. Twenty men in my own company fell dead or wounded, among them
      the captain and first lieutenant. Of what followed I can give you little
      idea. I gave myself up for lost. A desperate impulse enabled me to march
      on to what seemed certain destruction. All at once I felt a sensation of
      numbness in my left arm, and looking down, I saw that the blood was
      trickling from it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I had little time to think of myself. Hearing a smothered groan, I
      looked round, and saw Frank Grover, pale and reeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I'm shot in the leg,' he said. 'Don't leave me here. Help me along, and
      I will try to keep up with you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The poor lad leaned upon me, and we staggered forward. But not for long.
      A stone wall stared us in the face. Here rebel sharpshooters had been
      stationed, and they opened a galling fire upon us. We returned it, but
      what could we do? We were compelled to retire, and did so in good order,
      but unfortunately not until the sharpshooters had picked off some of our
      best men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Among the victims was the poor lad whom I assisted. A second bullet
      struck him in the heart. He uttered just one word, 'mother,' and fell.
      Poor boy, and poor mother! He seemed to have a premonition of his
      approaching death, and requested me the day previous to take charge of his
      effects, and send them with his love and a lock of his hair to his mother
      if anything should befall him. This request I shall at once comply with. I
      have succeeded in getting the poor fellow's body brought to camp, where it
      will be decently buried, and have cut from his head two brown locks, one
      for his mother, and one for myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At last we got back with ranks fearfully diminished. Many old familiar
      faces were gone&mdash;the faces of those now lying stiff and stark in
      death. More were groaning with anguish in the crowded hospital. My own
      wound was too trifling to require much attention. I shall have to wear a
      sling for a few days perhaps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is little more to tell. Until Tuesday evening we maintained our
      position in daily expectation of an attack. But none was made. This was
      more fortunate for us. I cannot understand what withheld the enemy from an
      assault.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On Tuesday suddenly came the order to re-cross the river. It was a stormy
      and dreary night, and so, of course, favorable to our purpose. The
      maneuver was executed in silence, and with commendable expedition. The
      rebels appeared to have no suspicion of General Burnside's intentions. The
      measured beat of our double quick was drowned by the fury of the storm,
      and with minds relieved, though bodies drenched, we once more found
      ourselves with the river between us and our foes. Nothing was left behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here we are again, but not all of us. Many a brave soldier has breathed
      his last, and lies under the sod. 'God's ways are dark, but soon or late
      they touch the shining hills of day.' So sings our own Whittier, and so I
      believe, in spite of the sorrowful disaster which we have met with. It is
      all for the best if we could but see it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our heavy losses of officers have rendered some new appointments
      necessary. Our second lieutenant has been made captain. The orderly
      sergeant and second sergeant are now our lieutenants, and the line of
      promotion has even reached me. I am a corporal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been drawn into writing a very long letter, and I must now close,
      with the promise of writing again very soon. After I have concluded, I
      must write to poor Frank Grover's mother. May God comfort her, for she has
      lost a boy of whom any mother might feel proud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With love to the children, I remain, as ever, your affectionate husband.
      HENRY FROST.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How terrible it must have been,&rdquo; said Mrs. Frost, with a shudder, as she
      folded up the letter and laid it down. &ldquo;We ought indeed to feel thankful
      that your father's life was spared.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I were three years older, I might have been in the battle,&rdquo; thought
      Frank.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXII. FRANK BROACHES A NEW PLAN
    </h2>
    <p>
      For some time Frank had been revolving in his mind the feasibility of a
      scheme which he hoped to be able to carry into execution. It was no less
      than this&mdash;to form a military company among the boys, which should be
      organized and drilled in all respects like those composed of older
      persons. He did not feel like taking any steps in the matter till he had
      consulted with some one in whose judgment he had confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening he mentioned his plan to Mr. Morton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a capital idea, Frank,&rdquo; said the young man, with warm approval. &ldquo;If
      I can be of service to you in this matter, it will afford me much
      pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is one difficulty,&rdquo; suggested Frank. &ldquo;None of us boys know anything
      about military tactics, and we shall need instruction to begin with; but
      where we are to find a teacher I am sure I can't tell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think you will have to look far,&rdquo; said Mr. Morton, with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you acquainted with the manual?&rdquo; asked Frank eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe so. You see you have not yet got to the end of my
      accomplishments. I shall be happy to act as your drill-master until some
      one among your number is competent to take my place. I can previously give
      you some private lessons, if you desire it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's nothing I should like better, Mr. Morton,&rdquo; said Frank joyfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you got a musket in the house, then? We shall get along better with
      one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's one in the attic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well; if you will get it, we can make a beginning now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frank went in search of the musket; but in his haste tumbled down the
      attic stairs, losing his grasp of the musket, which fell down with a
      clatter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Frost, opening the door of her bedroom in alarm, saw Frank on his
      back with the musket lying across his chest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter?&rdquo; she asked, not a little startled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank got up rubbing himself and looking rather foolish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, mother; only I was in a little too much of a hurry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you going to do with that musket, Frank?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Morton is going to teach me the manual, that is all, mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose the first position is horizontal,&rdquo; said his mother, with a
      smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't like that position very well,&rdquo; returned Frank, with a laugh. &ldquo;I
      prefer the perpendicular.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Under his friend's instructions, Frank progressed rapidly. At the end of
      the third lesson, Mr. Morton said, &ldquo;You are nearly as competent to give
      instructions now as I am. There are some things, however, that cannot be
      learned alone. You had better take measures to form your company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frank called upon Mr. Rathburn, the principal of the academy, and after
      communicating his plan, which met with the teacher's full approval,
      arranged to have notice given of a meeting of the boys immediately after
      the afternoon session.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Thursday afternoon when the last class had recited, previous to ringing
      the bell, which was a signal that school was over, Mr. Rathburn gave this
      brief notice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am requested to ask the boys present to remain in their seats, and in
      which I think they will all feel interested.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Looks of curiosity were interchanged among the boys, and every one
      thought, &ldquo;What's coming now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment a modest knock was heard, and Mr. Rathburn, going to the
      door, admitted Frank. He quietly slipped into the nearest seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your late schoolfellow, Frank Frost,&rdquo; proceeded Mr. Rathburn, &ldquo;has the
      merit of originating the plan to which I have referred, and he is no doubt
      prepared to unfold it to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Rathburn put on his hat and coat, and left the schoolroom. After his
      departure Frank rose and spoke modestly, thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boys, I have been thinking for some time past that we were not doing all
      that we ought in this crisis, which puts in such danger the welfare of our
      country. If anything, we boys ought to feel more deeply interested than
      our elders, for while they will soon pass off the stage we have not yet
      reached even the threshold of manhood. You will ask me what we can do. Let
      me remind you that when the war broke out the great want was, not of
      volunteers, but of men trained to military exercises. Our regiments were
      at first composed wholly of raw recruits. In Europe, military instruction
      is given as a matter of course; and in Germany, and perhaps other
      countries, young men are obliged to serve for a time in the army.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think we ought to profit by the lessons of experience. However the
      present war may turn out, we cannot be certain that other wars will not at
      some time break out. By that time we shall have grown to manhood, and the
      duty of defending our country in arms will devolve upon us. Should that
      time come, let it not find us unprepared. I propose that we organize a
      military company among the boys, and meet for drill at such times as we
      may hereafter agree upon. I hope that any who feel interested in the
      matter will express their opinions freely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frank sat down, and a number of the boys testified their approbation by
      stamping with their feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Haynes rose, with a sneer upon his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would humbly inquire, Mr. Chairman, for you appear to have assumed that
      position, whether you intend to favor us with your valuable services as
      drillmaster.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frank rose, with a flushed face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad to be reminded of one thing, which I had forgotten,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;As this is a meeting for the transaction of business, it is proper that
      it should be regularly organized. Will some one nominate a chairman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frank Frost!&rdquo; exclaimed half a dozen voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you for the nomination,&rdquo; said Frank, &ldquo;but as I have something
      further to communicate to the meeting, it will be better to select some
      one else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I nominate Charles Reynolds,&rdquo; said one voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Second the motion,&rdquo; said another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those who are in favor of Charles Reynolds, as chairman of this meeting,
      will please signify it in the usual manner,&rdquo; said Frank.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charles Reynolds, being declared duly elected, advanced to the teacher's
      chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Chairman,&rdquo; said Frank, &ldquo;I will now answer the question just put to
      me. I do not propose to offer my services as drill-master, but I am
      authorized to say that a gentleman whom you have all seen, Mr. Henry
      Morton, is willing to give instruction till you are sufficiently advanced
      to get along without it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Haynes, who felt disappointed at not having been called upon to
      preside over the meeting, determined to make as much trouble as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are we to know that this Morton is qualified to give instruction?&rdquo; he
      asked, looking round at the boys.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The gentleman is out of order. He will please address his remarks to the
      Chair, and not to the audience,&rdquo; said the presiding officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg pardon, Mr. Chairman,&rdquo; said John mockingly. &ldquo;I forgot how tenacious
      some people are of their brief authority.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Order! order!&rdquo; called half a dozen voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The gentleman will come to order,&rdquo; said the chairman firmly, &ldquo;and make
      way for others unless he can treat the Chair with proper respect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Chairman,&rdquo; said Frank, rising, &ldquo;I will mention, for the general
      information, that Mr. Morton has acted as an officer of militia, and that
      I consider his offer a kind one, since it will take up considerable of his
      time and put him to some trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I move that Mr. Morton's offer be accepted, with thanks,&rdquo; said Henry
      Tufts.
    </p>
    <p>
      The motion was seconded by Tom Wheeler, and carried unanimously, with the
      exception of one vote. John Haynes sat sullenly in his seat and took no
      part in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who shall belong to the company?&rdquo; asked the chairman. &ldquo;Shall a fixed age
      be required?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I move that the age be fixed at eleven,&rdquo; said Robert Ingalls.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was objected to as too young, and twelve was finally fixed upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Haynes moved not to admit any one who did not attend the academy. Of
      course, this would exclude Frank, and his motion was not seconded.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was finally decided to admit any above the age of twelve who desired
      it, but the boys reserved to themselves the right of rejecting any who
      should conduct himself in a manner to bring disgrace upon them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Chairman,&rdquo; said Frank, &ldquo;in order to get under way as soon as
      possible, I have written down an agreement to which those who wish to join
      our proposed company can sign their names. If anybody can think of
      anything better, I shall be glad to have it adopted instead of this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He handed a sheet of paper to the chairman, who read from it the following
      form of agreement: &ldquo;We, the subscribers, agree to form a boys' volunteer
      company, and to conform to the regulations which may hereafter be made for
      its government.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If there is no objection, we will adopt this form, and subscribe our
      names,&rdquo; said the chairman.
    </p>
    <p>
      The motion for adoption being carried, the boys came up one by one and
      signed their names.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Haynes would have held back, but for the thought that he might be
      elected an officer of the new company.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there any further business to come before the meeting?&rdquo; inquired the
      presiding officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The boys at Webbington had a company three or four years ago,&rdquo; said Joe
      Barry, &ldquo;and they used wooden guns.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wooden guns!&rdquo; exclaimed Wilbur Summerfield disdainfully. &ldquo;You won't catch
      me training round town with a wooden gun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would remind the last three gentlemen that their remarks should be
      addressed to the Chair,&rdquo; said the presiding officer. &ldquo;Of course, I don't
      care anything about it, but I think you would all prefer to have the
      meeting conducted properly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's so!&rdquo; exclaimed several boys.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said the chairman, &ldquo;I shall call to order any boy who addresses
      the meeting except through me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Chairman,&rdquo; said Frank, rising, &ldquo;as to the wooden guns, I quite agree
      with the last speaker. It would seem too much like boy's play, and we are
      too much in earnest for that. I have thought of an arrangement which can
      be made if the Selectmen will give their consent. Ten or fifteen years
      ago, longer than most of us can remember, as my father has told me, there
      was a militia company in Rossville, whose arms were supplied and owned by
      the town. When the company was disbanded the muskets went back to the
      town, and I believe they are now kept in the basement of the Town Hall. I
      presume that we can have the use of them on application. I move that a
      committee be appointed to lay the matter before the Selectmen and ask
      their permission.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His motion was agreed to.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will appoint John Haynes to serve on that committee,&rdquo; said the
      chairman, after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a politic appointment, as Squire Haynes was one of the Selectmen,
      and would be gratified at the compliment paid to his son.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I accept the duty,&rdquo; said John, rising, and speaking in a tone of
      importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there any other business to come before the meeting?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to inquire, Mr. Chairman, when our first meeting will take
      place, and where is it to be?&rdquo; asked Herbert Metcalf.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will appoint as a committee to make the necessary arrangements, Frank
      Frost, Tom Wheeler, and Robert Ingalls. Due notice will be given in school
      of the time and place selected, and a written notice will also be posted
      up in the postoffice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would it not be well, Mr. Chairman,&rdquo; suggested Frank, &ldquo;to circulate an
      invitation to other boys not present to-day to join the company? The
      larger our number, the more interest will be felt. I can think of quite a
      number who would be valuable members. There are Dick Bumstead, and William
      Chamberlain, and many others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the sound of Dick Bumstead's name John Haynes looked askance at Frank,
      but for the moment the thought of Dick's agency in the affair of the
      pig-pen had escaped his recollection, and he looked quite unconscious of
      any indirect reference to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you make a motion to that effect?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, if necessary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the motion seconded?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Second it,&rdquo; said Moses Rogers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will appoint Wilbur Summerfield and Moses Rogers on that committee,&rdquo;
       said the chairman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I move that the meeting adjourn ipse dixit,&rdquo; said Sam Davis, bringing out
      the latter phrase with considerable emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      A roar of laughter followed which shook the schoolhouse to the very
      rafters, and then a deafening clamor of applause. The proposer sat down in
      confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you laughing at?&rdquo; he burst forth indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Chairman,&rdquo; said Henry Tufts, struggling with his laughter, &ldquo;I second
      the gentleman's motion, all except the Latin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The motion was carried in spite of the manner in which it was worded, and
      the boys formed little groups, and began eagerly to discuss the plan which
      had been proposed. Frank had reason to feel satisfied with the success of
      his suggestion. Several of the boys came up to him and expressed their
      pleasure that he had brought the matter before them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, Frank,&rdquo; said Robert Ingalls, &ldquo;We'll have a bully company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Wilbur Summerfield, &ldquo;if John Haynes belongs to it. He's a
      bully, and no mistake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's that you are saying about me?&rdquo; blustered John Haynes, who caught a
      little of what was said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listeners never hear anything good of themselves,&rdquo; answered Wilbur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say that again, Wilbur Summerfield,&rdquo; said John menacingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, if it will do you any good. I said that you were a bully, John
      Haynes; and there's not a boy here that doesn't know it to be true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take care!&rdquo; said John, turning white with passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;While I'm about it, there's something more I want to say,&rdquo; continued
      Wilbur undauntedly. &ldquo;Yesterday you knocked my little brother off his sled
      and sent him home crying. If you do it again, you will have somebody else
      to deal with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John trembled with anger. It would have done him good to &ldquo;pitch into&rdquo;
       Wilbur, but the latter looked him in the face so calmly and resolutely
      that discretion seemed to him the better part of valor, and with an oath
      he turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know what's got into John Haynes,&rdquo; said Wilbur. &ldquo;I never liked
      him, but now he seems to be getting worse and worse every day.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIII. POMP TAKES MRS. PAYSON PRISONER
    </h2>
    <p>
      Old Mrs. Payson, who arrived in Rossville at the same time with Henry
      Morton, had been invited by her daughter, &ldquo;Cynthy Ann,&rdquo; to pass the
      winter, and had acquiesced without making any very strenuous objections.
      Her &ldquo;bunnit,&rdquo; which she had looked upon as &ldquo;sp'ilt,&rdquo; had been so far
      restored by a skilful milliner that she was able to wear it for best. As
      this restoration cost but one dollar and a half out of the five which had
      been given her by young Morton, she felt very well satisfied with the way
      matters had turned out. This did not, however, by any means diminish her
      rancor against Pomp, who had been the mischievous cause of the calamity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ef I could only get hold on him,&rdquo; Mrs. Payson had remarked on several
      occasions to Cynthy Ann, &ldquo;I'd shake the mischief out of him, ef I died
      for't the very next minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Payson was destined to meet with a second calamity, which increased,
      if possible, her antipathy to the &ldquo;young imp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Being of a social disposition, she was quite in the habit of dropping in
      to tea at different homes in the village. Having formerly lived in
      Rossville, she was acquainted with nearly all the townspeople, and went
      the rounds about once in two weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      One afternoon she put her knitting into a black work-bag, which she was
      accustomed to carry on her arm, and, arraying herself in a green cloak and
      hood, which had served her for fifteen years, she set out to call on Mrs.
      Thompson.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, the nearest route to the place of her destination lay across a
      five-acre lot. The snow lay deep upon the ground, but the outer surface
      had become so hard as, without difficulty, to bear a person of ordinary
      weight.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mrs. Payson came up to the bars, she said to herself, &ldquo;'Tain't so fur
      to go across lots. I guess I'll ventur'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She let down a bar and, passing through, went on her way complacently.
      But, alas, for the old lady's peace of mind! She was destined to come to
      very deep grief.
    </p>
    <p>
      That very afternoon Pomp had come over to play with Sam Thompson, and the
      two, after devising various projects of amusement, had determined to make
      a cave in the snow. They selected a part of the field where it had drifted
      to the depth of some four or five feet. Beginning at a little distance,
      they burrowed their way into the heart of the snow, and excavated a place
      about four feet square by four deep, leaving the upper crust intact, of
      course, without its ordinary strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two boys had completed their task, and were siting down in their
      subterranean abode, when the roof suddenly gave way, and a visitor entered
      in the most unceremonious manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old lady had kept on her way unsuspiciously, using as a cane a faded
      blue umbrella, which she carried invariably, whatever the weather.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mrs. Payson felt herself sinking, she uttered a loud shriek and waved
      her arms aloft, brandishing her umbrella in a frantic way. She was plunged
      up to her armpits in the snow, and was, of course, placed in a very
      unfavorable position for extricating herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two boys were at first nearly smothered by the descent of snow, but
      when the first surprise was over they recognized their prisoner. I am
      ashamed to say that their feeling was that of unbounded delight, and they
      burst into a roar of laughter. The sound, indistinctly heard, terrified
      the old lady beyond measure, and she struggled frantically to escape,
      nearly poking out Pomp's eye with the point of her umbrella.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pomp, always prompt to repel aggression, in return, pinched her foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Massy sakes! Where am I?&rdquo; ejaculated the affrighted old lady. &ldquo;There's
      some wild crittur down there. Oh, Cynthy Ann, ef you could see your marm
      at this moment!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She made another vigorous flounder, and managed to kick Sam in the face.
      Partly as a measure of self-defense, he seized her ankle firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's got hold of me!&rdquo; shrieked the old lady &ldquo;Help! help! I shall be
      murdered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her struggles became so energetic that the boys soon found it expedient to
      evacuate the premises. They crawled out by the passage they had made, and
      appeared on the surface of the snow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old lady presented a ludicrous appearance. Her hood had slipped off,
      her spectacles were resting on the end of her nose, and she had lost her
      work-bag. But she clung with the most desperate energy to the umbrella, on
      which apparently depended her sole hope of deliverance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hi yah!&rdquo; laughed Pomp, as he threw himself back on the snow and began to
      roll about in an ecstasy of delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instantly Mrs. Payson's apprehensions changed to furious anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it's you, you little varmint, that's done this. Jest le' me get out,
      and I'll whip you so you can't stan'. See ef I don't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can't get out, missus; yah, yah!&rdquo; laughed Pomp. &ldquo;You's tied, you is,
      missus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come an' help me out, this minute!&rdquo; exclaimed the old lady, stamping her
      foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lor', missus, you'll whip me. You said you would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I will, I vum,&rdquo; retorted the irate old lady, rather undiplomatically.
      &ldquo;As true as I live, I'll whip you till you can't stan'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke, she brandished her umbrella in a menacing manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Den, missus, I guess you'd better stay where you is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you imp. See ef I don't have you put in jail. Here, you, Sam
      Thompson, come and help me out. Ef you don't, I'll tell your mother, an'
      she'll give you the wust lickin' you ever had. I'm surprised at you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won't tell on me, will you?&rdquo; said Sam, irresolutely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll see about it,&rdquo; said the old lady, in a politic tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      She felt her powerlessness, and that concession must precede victory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, give me the umbrella,&rdquo; said Sam, who evidently distrusted her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll run off with it,&rdquo; said Mrs. Payson suspiciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I won't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there 'tis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come here, Pomp, and help me,&rdquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pomp held aloof.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She'll whip me,&rdquo; he said, shaking his head. &ldquo;She's an old debble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you&mdash;you sarpint!&rdquo; ejaculated the old lady, almost speechless
      with indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can run away as soon as she gets out,&rdquo; suggested Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pomp advanced slowly and warily, rolling his eyes in indecision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jest catch hold of my hands, both on ye,&rdquo; said Mrs. Payson, &ldquo;an' I'll
      give a jump.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These directions were followed, and the old lady rose to the surface,
      when, in an evil hour, intent upon avenging herself upon Pomp, she made a
      clutch for his collar. In doing so she lost her footing and fell back into
      the pit from which she had just emerged. Her spectacles dropped off and,
      falling beneath her, were broken.
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose, half-provoked and half-ashamed of her futile attempt. It was
      natural that neither of these circumstances should effect an improvement
      in her temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did it a purpose,&rdquo; she said, shaking her fist at Pomp, who stood
      about a rod off, grinning at her discomfiture. &ldquo;There, I've gone an' broke
      my specs, that I bought two years ago, come fall, of a pedler. I'll make
      you pay for 'em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lor', missus, I ain't got no money,&rdquo; said Pomp. &ldquo;Nebber had none.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately for the old lady, it was altogether probable that Pomp spoke
      the truth this time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three and sixpence gone!&rdquo; groaned Mrs. Payson. &ldquo;Fust my bunnit, an' then
      my specs. I'm the most unfort'nit' crittur. Why don't you help me, Sam
      Thompson, instead of standin' and gawkin' at me?&rdquo; she suddenly exclaimed,
      glaring at Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't know as you was ready,&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;You might have been out
      before this, ef you hadn't let go. Here, Pomp, lend a hand.&rdquo; Pomp shook
      his head decisively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't catch dis chile again,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I'm goin' home. Ole woman wants
      to lick me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sam endeavored to persuade Pomp, but he was deaf to persuasion. He
      squatted down on the snow, and watched the efforts his companion made to
      extricate the old lady. When she was nearly out he started on a run, and
      was at a safe distance before Mrs. Payson was in a situation to pursue
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old lady shook herself to make sure that no bones were broken. Next,
      she sent Sam down into the hole to pick up her bag, and then, finding, on
      a careful examination, that she had recovered everything, even to the blue
      umbrella, fetched the astonished Sam a rousing box on the ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you do that for?&rdquo; he demanded in an aggrieved tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Taint half as much as you deserve,&rdquo; said the old lady. &ldquo;I'm goin' to
      your house right off, to tell your mother what you've been a-doin'. Ef you
      was my child, I'd beat you black and blue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I'd left you down there,&rdquo; muttered Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's that?&rdquo; demanded Mrs. Payson sharply. &ldquo;Don't you go to bein' sassy.
      It'll be the wuss for ye. You'll come to the gallows some time, ef you
      don't mind your p's and q's. I might 'ave stayed there till I died, an'
      then you'd have been hung.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are, you jawing about?&rdquo; retorted Sam. &ldquo;How could I know you was
      comin'?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know'd it well enough,&rdquo; returned the old lady. &ldquo;You'll bring your
      mother's gray hairs with sorrer to the grave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She ain't got any gray hairs,&rdquo; said Sam doggedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, she will have some, ef she lives long enough. I once know'd a boy
      just like you, an' he was put in jail for stealin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain't a-goin to stay and be jawed that way,&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;You won't catch
      me pulling you out of a hole again. I wouldn't have you for a grandmother
      for all the world. Tom Baldwin told me, only yesterday, that you was
      always a-hectorin' him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tom Baldwin was the son of Cynthy Ann, and consequently old Mrs. Payson's
      grandson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did Tom Baldwin tell you that?&rdquo; demanded the old lady abruptly, looking
      deeply incensed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he's the ungratefullest cub that I ever sot eyes on,&rdquo; exclaimed his
      indignant grandmother. &ldquo;Arter all I've done for him. I'm knittin' a pair
      of socks for him this blessed minute. But he sha'n't have 'em. I'll give
      'em to the soldiers, I vum. Did he say anything else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he said he should be glad when you were gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll go right home and tell Cynthy Ann,&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Payson, &ldquo;an' if
      she don't w'ip him I will. I never see such a bad set of boys as is
      growin' up. There ain't one on 'em that isn't as full of mischief as a nut
      is of meat. I'll come up with them, as true as I live.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Full of her indignation, Mrs. Payson gave up her proposed call on Mrs.
      Thompson, and, turning about, hurried home to lay her complaint before
      Cynthy Ann.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm glad she's gone,&rdquo; said Sam, looking after her, as with resolute steps
      she trudged along, punching the snow vigorously with the point of her blue
      cotton umbrella. &ldquo;I pity Tom Baldwin; if I had such a grandmother as that,
      I'd run away to sea. That's so!&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XXIV. A CHAPTER FROM HARDEE
    </h2>
    <p>
      A few rods east of the post-office, on the opposite side of the street,
      was a two-story building used as an engine-house, The second story
      consisted of a hall used for company meetings. This the fire company
      obligingly granted to the boys as a drill-room during the inclement
      season, until the weather became sufficiently warm to drill out of doors.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the Monday afternoon succeeding the preliminary meeting at the academy,
      about thirty boys assembled in this hall, pursuant to a notice which had
      been given at school and posted up at the tavern and post-office.
    </p>
    <p>
      At half-past two Frank entered, accompanied by Mr. Morton.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the boys were already acquainted with him, and came up to speak.
      He had a frank, cordial way with boys, which secured their favor at first
      sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, boys,&rdquo; said he pleasantly, &ldquo;I believe I am expected to make
      soldiers of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said Charles Reynolds respectfully: &ldquo;I hope we shall learn
      readily and do credit to your instructions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no fear on that score,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;Perhaps you may have some
      business to transact before we commence our lessons. If so, I will sit
      down a few minutes and wait till you are ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A short business meeting was held, organized as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Haynes reported that he had spoken to his father, and the question of
      allowing the boys the use of the muskets belonging to the town would be
      acted upon at the next meeting of the Selectmen. Squire Haynes thought
      that the request would be granted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are we going to do this afternoon?&rdquo; asked Robert Ingalls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can answer that question, Mr. Chairman,&rdquo; said Henry Morton. &ldquo;We are not
      yet ready for muskets. I shall have to drill you first in the proper
      position of a soldier, and the military step. Probably it will be a week
      before I shall wish to place muskets into your hands. May I inquire how
      soon there will be a meeting of the Selectmen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Haynes announced that the next meeting would be held in less than a
      week.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then there will be no difficulty as to the muskets,&rdquo; said Mr. Morton.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wilbur Summerfield reported that he had extended an invitation to boys not
      connected with the academy to join the company. Several were now present.
      Dick Bumstead, though not able to attend that day, would come to the next
      meeting. He thought they would be able to raise a company of fifty boys.
    </p>
    <p>
      This report was considered very satisfactory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom Wheeler arose and inquired by what name the new company would be
      called.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I move,&rdquo; said Robert Ingalls, &ldquo;that we take the name of the Rossville
      Home Guards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the enemy should invade Rossville, you'd be the first to run,&rdquo; sneered
      John Haynes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not unless I heard it before you,&rdquo; was the quick reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a general laugh, and cries of &ldquo;Bully for you, Bob!&rdquo; were heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Order!&rdquo; cried the chairman, pounding the table energetically. &ldquo;Such
      disputes cannot be allowed. I think we had better defer obtaining a name
      for our company till we find how well we are likely to succeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This proposal seemed to be acquiesced in by the boys generally. The
      business meeting terminated, and Mr. Morton was invited to commence his
      instructions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The boys will please form themselves in a line,&rdquo; said the teacher, in a
      clear, commanding voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was done.
    </p>
    <p>
      The positions assumed were, most of them, far from military. Some stood
      with their legs too far apart, others with one behind the other, some with
      the shoulders of unequal height. Frank alone stood correctly, thanks to
      the private instructions he had received.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, boys,&rdquo; said Mr. Morton, &ldquo;when I say 'attention!' you must all look
      at me and follow my directions implicitly. Attention and subordination are
      of the first importance to a soldier. Let me say, to begin with, that,
      with one exception, you are all standing wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here there was a general shifting of positions. Robert Ingalls, who had
      been standing with his feet fifteen inches apart, suddenly brought them
      close together in a parallel position. Tom Wheeler, who had been resting
      his weight mainly on the left foot, shifted to the right. Moses Rogers,
      whose head was bent over so as to watch his feet, now threw it so far back
      that he seemed to be inspecting the ceiling. Frank alone remained
      stationary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Morton smiled at the changes elicited by his remarks, and proceeded to
      give his first command.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heels on the same line!&rdquo; he ordered.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the boys turned their heads, and there was a noisy shuffling of feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quit crowding, Tom Baldwin!&rdquo; exclaimed Sam Rivers in an audible tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quit crowding, yourself,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;You've got more room than I,
      now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silence in the ranks!&rdquo; said the instructor authoritatively. &ldquo;Frank Frost,
      I desire you to see that the boys stand at regular distances.&rdquo; This was
      accomplished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Turn out your feet equally, so as to form a right angle with each other.
      So.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Morton illustrated his meaning practically. This was very necessary,
      as some of the boys had very confused ideas as to what was meant by a
      right angle.
    </p>
    <p>
      After some time this order was satisfactorily carried out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The knees must be straight. I see that some are bent, as if the weight of
      the body were too much for them. Not too stiff! Rivers, yours are too
      rigid. You couldn't walk a mile in that way without becoming very tired.
      There, that is much better. Notice my position.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boys, after adjusting their positions, looked at the rest to see how
      they had succeeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't look at each other,&rdquo; said Mr. Morton. &ldquo;If you do you will be
      certain to make blunders. I notice that some of you are standing with one
      shoulder higher than the other. The shoulders should be square, and the
      body should be erect upon the hips. Attention! So!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. Haynes, you are trying to stand too upright. You must not bend
      backward. All, incline your bodies a little forward. Frank Ingalls is
      standing correctly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think that's very soldierly,&rdquo; said John Haynes, who felt
      mortified at being corrected, having flattered himself that he was right
      and the rest were wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A soldier shouldn't be round-shouldered, or have a slouching gait,&rdquo; said
      the instructor quietly; &ldquo;but you will find when you come to march that the
      opposite extreme is attended with great inconvenience and discomfort.
      Until then you must depend upon my assurance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Morton ran his eye along the line, and observed that most of the boys
      were troubled about their arms. Some allowed them to hang in stiff
      rigidity by their sides. One, even, had his clasped behind his back.
      Others let theirs dangle loosely, swinging now hither, now thither.
    </p>
    <p>
      He commented upon these errors, and added, &ldquo;Let your arms hang naturally,
      with the elbows near the body, the palm of the hand a little turned to the
      front, the little finger behind the seam of the pantaloons. This you will
      find important when you come to drill with muskets. You will find that it
      will economize space by preventing your occupying more room than is
      necessary. Frank, will you show Sam Rivers and John Haynes how to hold
      their hands?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn't trouble yourself,&rdquo; said John haughtily, but in too low a
      voice, as he supposed, for Mr. Morton to hear. &ldquo;I don't want a clodhopper
      to teach me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frank's face flushed slightly, and without a word he passed John and
      occupied himself with showing Sam Rivers, who proved more tractable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No talking in the ranks!&rdquo; said Mr. Morton, in a tone of authority. &ldquo;If
      any boy wishes to ask any explanation of me he may do so, but it is a
      breach of discipline to speak to each other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My next order will be, 'Faces to the front!'&rdquo; he resumed, after a pause.
      &ldquo;Nothing looks worse than to see a file of men with heads turned in
      various directions. The eyes should be fixed straight before you, striking
      the ground at about fifteen paces forward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It required some time to have this direction properly carried out. Half an
      hour had now passed, and some of the boys showed signs of weariness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will now give you a little, breathing-spell for ten minutes,&rdquo; said Mr.
      Morton. &ldquo;After this we will resume our exercises.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boys stretched their limbs, and began to converse in an animated
      strain about the lesson which they had just received.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the expiration of ten minutes the lesson was resumed, and some
      additional directions were given.
    </p>
    <p>
      It will not be necessary for us to follow the boys during the remainder of
      the lesson. Most of them made very creditable progress, and the line
      presented quite a different appearance at the end of the exercise from
      what it had at the commencement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be prepared to give you a second lesson on Saturday afternoon,&rdquo;
       announced Mr. Morton. &ldquo;In the meantime it will be well for you to remember
      what I have said, and if you should feel inclined to practice by
      yourselves, it will no doubt make your progress more rapid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These remarks were followed by a clapping of hands on the part of the boys&mdash;a
      demonstration of applause which Mr. Morton acknowledged by a bow and a
      smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, how do you like it?&rdquo; asked Frank Frost of Robert Ingalls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it's bully fun!&rdquo; returned Bob enthusiastically. &ldquo;I feel like a hero
      already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're as much of one now, Bob, as you'll ever be,&rdquo; said Wilbur
      good-naturedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn't advise you to be a soldier,&rdquo; retorted Bob. &ldquo;You're too fat to
      run, and would be too frightened to fight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I certainly couldn't expect to keep up with those long legs of yours,
      Bob,&rdquo; said Wilbur, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boys dispersed in excellent humor, fully determined to persevere in
      their military exercises.
    </p>

      CHAPTER XXV. ELECTION OF OFFICERS
    </h2>
    <p>
      For the six weeks following, Mr. Morton gave lessons twice a week to the
      boys. At the third lesson they received their muskets, and thenceforth
      drilled with them. A few, who had not been present at the first two
      lessons, and were consequently ignorant of the positions, Mr. Morton
      turned over to Frank, who proved an efficient and competent instructor.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of the twelfth lesson, Mr. Morton, after giving the order
      &ldquo;Rest!&rdquo; addressed the boys as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boys, we have now taken twelve lessons together. I have been very much
      gratified by the rapid improvement which you have made, and feel that it
      is due quite as much to your attention as to any instructions of mine. I
      can say with truth that I have known companies of grown men who have made
      less rapid progress than you.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The time has now come when I feel that I can safely leave you to
      yourselves, There are those among you who are competent to carry on the
      work which I have commenced. It will be desirable for you at once to form
      a company organization. As there are but fifty on your muster-roll, being
      about half the usual number, you will not require as many officers. I
      recommend the election of a captain, first and second lieutenants, three
      sergeants and three corporals. You have already become somewhat accustomed
      to company drill, so that you will be able to go on by yourselves under
      the guidance of your officers. If any doubtful questions should arise, I
      shall always be happy to give you any information or assistance in my
      power.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, boys, I will bid you farewell in my capacity of instructor, but
      I need not say that I shall continue to watch with interest your progress
      in the military art.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here Mr. Morton bowed, and sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the applause which followed his speech had subsided, there was a
      silence and hush of expectation among the boys, after which Charles
      Reynolds rose slowly, and, taking from the seat beside him a package,
      advanced toward Mr. Morton and made a brief speech of presentation, having
      been deputed by the boys to perform that duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;MR MORTON: I stand here in behalf of the boys present, who wish to
      express to you their sense of your kindness in giving them the course of
      lessons which has just ended. We have taken up much of your time, and no
      doubt have tried your patience more than once. If we have improved, as you
      were kind enough to say, we feel that it is principally owing to our good
      fortune in having so skilful a teacher. We wish to present you some
      testimonial of the regard which we have for you, and accordingly ask your
      acceptance of this copy of 'Abbott's Life of Napoleon.' We should have
      been glad to give you something more valuable, but we are sure you will
      value the gift for other reasons than its cost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here Charles Reynolds sat down, and all eyes were turned toward Mr.
      Morton. It was evident that he was taken by surprise. It was equally
      evident that he was much gratified by this unexpected token of regard.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose and with much feeling spoke as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear boys, for you must allow me to call you so, I can hardly tell you
      how much pleasure your kind gift has afforded me. It gives me the
      assurance, which indeed, I did not need, that you are as much my friends
      as I am yours. The connection between us has afforded me much pleasure and
      satisfaction. In training you to duties which patriotism may hereafter
      devolve upon you, though I pray Heaven that long before that time our
      terrible civil strife may be at an end, I feel that I have helped you to
      do something to show your loyal devotion to the country which we all love
      and revere.&rdquo; Here there was loud applause. &ldquo;If you were a few years older,
      I doubt not that your efforts would be added to those of your fathers and
      brothers who are now encountering the perils and suffering the privations
      of war. And with a little practise I am proud to say that you would not
      need to be ashamed of the figure you would cut in the field.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have little more to say. I recognize a fitness in the selection of the
      work which you have given me. Napoleon is without doubt the greatest
      military genius which our modern age has produced. Yet he lacked one very
      essential characteristic of a good soldier. He was more devoted to his own
      selfish ends than to the welfare of his country. I shall value your gift
      for the good wishes that accompany it, and the recollection of this day
      will be among my pleasantest memories.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Morton here withdrew in the midst of hearty applause.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had left the hall a temporary organization for business purposes
      was at once effected. Wilbur Summerfield was placed in the chair, and the
      meeting proceeded at once to an election of officers.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a week or two past there had been considerable private canvassing
      among the boys. There were several who would like to have been elected
      captain, and a number of others who, though not aspiring so high, hoped to
      be first or second lieutenants. Among the first class was John Haynes.
      Like many persons who are unpopular, he did not seem to be at all aware of
      the extent of his unpopularity.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was another weighty reason why the choice of the boys would
      never have fallen upon him. Apart from his unpopularity, he was
      incompetent for the posts to which he aspired. Probably there were not ten
      boys in the company who were not more proficient in drill than he. This
      was not owing to any want of natural capacity, but to a feeling that he
      did not require much instruction and a consequent lack of attention to the
      directions of Mr. Morton. He had frequently been corrected in mistakes,
      but always received the correction with sullenness and impatience. He felt
      in his own mind that he was much better fitted to govern than to obey,
      forgetting in his ambition that it is those only who have first learned to
      obey who are best qualified to rule others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Desirious of ingratiating himself with the boys, and so securing their
      votes, he had been unusually amiable and generous during the past week. At
      the previous lesson he had brought half a bushel of apples, from which he
      had requested the boys to help themselves freely. By this means he hoped
      to attain the object of his ambition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Squire Haynes, too, was interested in the success of his son.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If they elect you captain, John,&rdquo; he promised, &ldquo;I will furnish you money
      enough to buy a handsome sash and sword.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Besides John, there were several others who cherished secret hopes of
      success. Among these were Charles Reynolds and Wilbur Summerfield. As for
      Frank Frost, though he had thought little about it, he could not help
      feeling that he was among those best qualified for office, though he would
      have been quite content with either of the three highest offices, or even
      with the post of orderly sergeant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among those who had acquitted themselves with the greatest credit was our
      old friend Dick Bumstead, whom we remember last as concerned in rather a
      questionable adventure. Since that time his general behavior had very much
      changed for the better. Before, he had always shirked work when it was
      possible. Now he exhibited a steadiness and industry which surprised no
      less than it gratified his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      This change was partly owing to his having given up some companions who
      had done him no good, and, instead, sought the society of Frank. The
      energy and manliness exhibited by his new friend, and the sensible views
      which he took of life and duty, had wrought quite a revolution in Dick's
      character. He began to see that if he ever meant to accomplish anything he
      must begin now. At Frank's instance he had given up smoking, and this cut
      off one of the temptations which had assailed him. Gradually the opinion
      entertained of Dick in the village as a ne'er-do-well was modified, and he
      had come to be called as one of the steady and reliable boys&mdash;a
      reputation not to, be lightly regarded.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the present election Dick did not dream that he could have any
      interest. While he had been interested in the lessons, and done his best,
      he felt that his previous reputation would injure his chance, and he had
      made up his mind that he should have to serve in the ranks. This did not
      trouble him, for Dick, to his credit be it said, was very free from
      jealousy, and had not a particle of envy in his composition. He possessed
      so many good qualities that it would have been a thousand pities if he had
      kept on in his former course.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will bring in your votes for captain,&rdquo; said the chairman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom Wheeler distributed slips of paper among the boys, and there was
      forthwith a plentiful show of pencils.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are the votes all in?&rdquo; inquired the chairman, a little later. &ldquo;If so, we
      will proceed to count them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a general hush of expectation while Wilbur Summerfield, the
      chairman, and Robert Ingalls, the secretary of the meeting, were counting
      the votes. John Haynes, was evidently nervous, and fidgeted about, anxious
      to learn his fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length the count was completed, and Wilbur, rising, announced it as
      follows:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
      Whole number of votes...... 49
      Necessary for a choice..... 25
      Robert Ingalls.............. 2 votes
      John Haynes................. 2  &rdquo;
       Wilbur Summerfield.......... 4  &rdquo;
       Moses Rogers................ 4  &rdquo;
       Charles Reynolds........... 10  &rdquo;
       Frank Frost................ 27  &rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen, I have the pleasure of announcing that you have made choice of
      Frank Frost as your captain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frank rose amid a general clapping of hands, and, with heightened color
      but modest self-possession, spoke as follows &ldquo;Boys, I thank you very much
      for this proof of your confidence. All I can say is that I will endeavor
      to deserve it. I shall no doubt make some mistakes, but I feel sure that
      you will grant me your indulgence, and not expect too much of my
      inexperience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This speech was regarded with favor by all except John Haynes, who would
      rather have had any one else elected, independent of his own
      disappointment, which was great.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will now prepare your votes for first lieutenant,&rdquo; said the presiding
      officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      It will be noticed that two votes were cast for John Haynes. One of these
      was thrown by a competitor, who wished to give his vote to some one who
      stood no possible chance of succeeding, and accordingly selected John on
      account of his well-known unpopularity. This vote, therefore, was far from
      being a compliment. As for the other vote, John Haynes himself best knew
      by whom it was cast.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boys began to prepare their votes for first lieutenant.
    </p>
    <p>
      John brightened up a little. He felt that it would be something to gain
      this office. But when the result of the balloting was announced it proved
      that he had but a single vote.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were several scattering votes. The two prominent candidates were
      Dick Bumstead, who received eight votes, and Charles Reynolds, who
      received thirty-two, and was accordingly declared elected.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one was more surprised by this announcement than Dick. He felt quite
      bewildered, not having the slightest expectation of being a candidate. He
      was almost tempted to believe that the votes had only been cast in jest.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Dick was destined to a still greater surprise. At the next vote, for
      second lieutenant, there were five scattering votes. Then came ten for
      Wilbur Summerfield, and Richard Bumstead led off with thirty-four, and was
      accordingly declared elected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speech! speech!&rdquo; exclaimed half a dozen, vociferously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dick looked a little confused, and tried to escape the call. But the boys
      were determined to have him up, and he was finally compelled to rise,
      looking and feeling rather awkward But his natural good sense and
      straightforwardness came to his aid, and he acquitted himself quite
      creditably.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was Dick's speech:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boys, I don't know how to make speeches, and I s'pose you know that as
      well as I do. I hardly knew who was meant when Richard Bumstead's name was
      mentioned, having always been called Dick, but if it means me, all I can
      say is, that I am very much obliged to you for the unexpected honor. One
      reason why I did not expect to be elected to any office was because I
      ain't as good a scholar as most of you. I am sure there are a great many
      of you who would make better officers than I, but I don't think there's
      any that will try harder to do well than I shall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here Dick sat down, very much astonished to find that he had actually made
      a speech. His speech was modest, and made a favorable impression, as was
      shown by the noisy stamping of feet and shouts of &ldquo;Bully for you, Dick!&rdquo;
       &ldquo;You're a trump!&rdquo; and other terms in which boys are wont to signify their
      approbation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through all this John Haynes looked very much disgusted, and seemed
      half-decided upon leaving the room. He had some curiosity, however, to
      learn who would be elected to the subordinate offices, and so remained. He
      had come into the room with the determination not to accept anything below
      a lieutenancy, but now made up his mind not to reject the post of orderly
      sergeant if it should be offered to him. The following list of officers,
      however will show that he was allowed no choice in the matter:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
      Captain, Frank Frost.
      First Lieutenant, Charles Reynolds.
      Second Lieutenant, Richard Bumstead.
      Orderly Sergeant, Wilbur Summerfield.
      Second Sergeant, Robert Ingalls.
      Third Sergeant, Moses Rogers.
      First Corporal, Tom Wheeler.
      Second Corporal, Joseph Barry.
      Third Corporal, Frank Ingalls.
</pre>
    <p>
      The entire list of officers was now read and received with applause. If
      there were some who were disappointed, they acquiesced good-naturedly,
      with one exception.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the applause had subsided, John Haynes rose and, in a voice trembling
      with passion, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Chairman, I wish to give notice to all present that I resign my place
      as a member of this company. I don't choose to serve under such officers
      as you have chosen to-day. I don't think they are fit to have command.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here there was a general chorus of hisses, drowning John's voice
      completely. After glancing about him a moment in speechless fury, he
      seized his hat, and left the room in indignant haste, slamming the door
      after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's a mean fellow!&rdquo; said Frank Ingalls. &ldquo;I suppose he expected to be
      captain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shouldn't wonder,&rdquo; said Sam Rivers. &ldquo;Anyhow, he's a fool to make such a
      fuss about it. As for me,&rdquo; he added, with a mirthful glance, &ldquo;I am just as
      much disappointed as he is. When I came here this afternoon I expected I
      should be elected captain, and I'd got my speech all ready, but now I'm
      sorry that it will have to be wasted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a general burst of laughter, for Sam Rivers, whom everybody
      liked for his good nature, was incorrigibly awkward, and had made a larger
      number of blunders, probably, than any other member of the company.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give us the speech, Sam,&rdquo; said Bob Ingalls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, don't let it be wasted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speech! speech!&rdquo; cried Joseph Barry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, gentlemen, if you desire it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sam drew from his pocket a blank piece of paper, and pretended to read the
      following speech, which he made up on the spur of the moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ahem! gentlemen,&rdquo; he commenced, in a pompous tone, assuming an air of
      importance; &ldquo;I am deeply indebted to you for this very unexpected honor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, very,&rdquo; said one of the boys near.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel that you have done yourself credit in your selection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here there was a round of applause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry that some of you are still very awkward, but I hope under my
      excellent discipline to make veterans of you in less than no time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good for you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cannot expect me to remain long with you, as I am now in the line of
      promotion, and don't mean to stop short of a brigadier. But as long as I
      am your captain I hope you will appreciate your privileges.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sam's speech was followed by a chorus of laughter, in which he joined
      heartily himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for John's defection, nobody seemed to regret it much. It was generally
      felt that the company would have no difficulty in getting along without
      him.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVI. THE REBEL TRAP
    </h2>
    <p>
      ON the first of April Frank received the following letter from his father.
      It was the more welcome because nearly a month had elapsed since anything
      had been received, and the whole family had become quite anxious:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Frank,&rdquo; the letter commenced, &ldquo;you are no doubt feeling anxious on
      account of my long silence. You will understand the cause of it when I
      tell you that since the date of my last letter I have been for a fortnight
      in the enemy's hands as a prisoner. Fortunately, I have succeeded in
      effecting my escape. You will naturally be interested to learn the
      particulars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three weeks since, a lady occupying an estate about five miles distant
      from our camp waited on our commanding officer and made an urgent request
      to have a few soldiers detailed as a guard to protect her and her property
      from molestation and loss. Our colonel was not at first disposed to grant
      her request, but finally acceded to it, rather reluctantly, declaring that
      it was all nonsense. I was selected, with five other men, to serve as a
      guard. Mrs. Roberts&mdash;for this was her name&mdash;appeared quite
      satisfied to find her request granted, and drove slowly home under our
      escort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On arriving, we found a mansion in the old Virginia style, low in
      elevation, broad upon the ground, and with a piazza extending along the
      front. Surrounding it was a good-sized plantation. At a little distance
      from the house was a row of negro huts. These were mostly vacant, the
      former occupants having secured their freedom by taking refuge within our
      lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As sergeant in command&mdash;you must know that I have been promoted&mdash;I
      inquired of Mrs. Roberts what danger she apprehended. Her answers were
      vague and unsatisfactory. However, she seemed disposed to treat me very
      civilly, and at nine o'clock invited the whole party into the house to
      partake of a little refreshment. This invitation was very welcome to
      soldiers who had not for months partaken of anything better than camp
      fare. It was all the more acceptable because outside a cold rain was
      falling, and the mod was deep and miry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the dining-room we found a plentiful meal spread, including hot
      coffee, hot corn bread, bacon, and other viands. We were not, however,
      destined to take our supper in peace. As I was drinking my second cup of
      coffee I thought I heard a noise outside, and remarked it to Mrs. Roberts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'It is only the wind, sergeant,' said she, indifferently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was not long before I became convinced that it was something more
      serious. I ordered my men to stand to their arms, in spite of the urgent
      protestations of the old lady, and marched them out upon the lawn, just in
      time to be confronted by twenty or thirty men on horseback, clad in the
      rebel uniform.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Resistance against such odds would have been only productive of useless
      loss of life, and with my little force I was compelled to surrender myself
      a prisoner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, I no longer doubted that we were the victims of a trick, and
      had been lured by Mrs. Roberts purposely to be made prisoners. If I had
      had any doubts on the subject, her conduct would have dissipated them. She
      received our captors with open arms. They stepped into our places as
      guests, and the house was thrown open to them. Our arms were taken from
      us, our hands pinioned, and a scene of festivity ensued. A cask of wine
      was brought up from the cellar, and the contents freely distributed among
      the rebels, or gray backs, as we call them here.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once, as Mrs. Roberts passed through the little room where we were
      confined, I said, 'Do you consider this honorable conduct, madam, to lure
      us here by false representations, and then betray us to our enemies?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Yes, I do!' said she hotly. 'What business have you to come down here
      and lay waste our territory? There is no true Southern woman but despises
      you heartily, and would do as much as I have, and more, too. You've got my
      son a prisoner in one of your Yankee prisons. When I heard that he was
      taken, I swore to be revenged, and I have kept my word. I've got ten for
      one, though he's worth a hundred such as you!'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So saying, she swept out of the room, with a scornful look of triumph in
      her eyes. The next day, as I afterward learned, she sent word to our
      colonel that her house had been unexpectedly attacked by a large party of
      the rebels, and that we had been taken prisoners. Her complicity was
      suspected, but was not proved till our return to the camp. Of course, a
      further guard, which she asked for, to divert suspicion, was refused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meanwhile we were carried some twenty miles across the river, and
      confined in a building which had formerly been used as a storehouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The place was dark and gloomy. There were some dozen others who shared
      our captivity. Here we had rather a doleful time. We were supplied with
      food three times a day; but the supply was scanty, and we had meat but
      once in two days. We gathered that it was intended to send us to Richmond;
      but from day to day there was a delay in doing so. We decided that our
      chance of escape would be much better then than after we reached the rebel
      capital. We, therefore, formed a plan for defeating the intentions of our
      captors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Though the building assigned to us as a prison consisted of two stories,
      we were confined in the lower part. This was more favorable to our
      designs. During the night we busied ourselves in loosening two of the
      planks of the flooring, so that we could remove them at any time. Then
      lowering two of our number into the cellar, we succeeded in removing
      enough of the stone foundation to allow the escape of one man at a time
      through the aperture. Our arrangements were hastened by the assignment of
      a particular day on which we were to be transferred from our prison, and
      conveyed to Richmond. Though we should have been glad to enter the city
      under some circumstances, we did not feel very desirous of going as
      prisoners of war.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the night selected we waited impatiently till midnight. Then, as
      silently as possible, we removed the planking, and afterwards the stones
      of the basement wall, and crept through one by one. All this was effected
      so noiselessly that we were all out without creating any alarm. We could
      hear the measured tramp of the sentinel, as he paced up and down in front
      of the empty prison. We pictured to ourselves his surprise when he
      discovered, the next morning, that we escaped under his nose without his
      knowing it!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I need not dwell upon the next twenty-four hours. The utmost vigilance
      was required to elude the rebel pickets. At last, after nearly twenty
      hours, during which we had nothing to eat, we walked into camp, exhausted
      with hunger and fatigue, to the great joy of our comrades from whom we had
      been absent a fortnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On receiving information of the manner in which we had been captured, our
      commanding officer at once despatched me with a detachment of men to
      arrest Mrs. Roberts and her daughter. Her surprise and dismay at seeing me
      whom she supposed safe in Richmond were intense. She is still under
      arrest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose our campaign will open as soon as the roads are dried up. The
      mud in Virginia is much more formidable than at the North, and presents an
      insuperable, perhaps I should say an unfathomable, obstacle to active
      operations. I hope General Grant will succeed in taking Vicksburg. The
      loss of that important stronghold would be a great blow to the rebels.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ask me, in your last letter, whether I see much of the contrabands. I
      have talked with a considerable number. One, a very intelligent fellow,
      had been very much trusted by his master, and had accompanied him to
      various parts of the South. I asked him the question: 'Is it true that
      there are a considerable number of slaves who would prefer to remain in
      their present condition to becoming free?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Nebber see any such niggers, massa,' he answered, shaking his head
      decisively. 'We all want to be free. My old massa treated me kindly, but
      I'd a left him any minute to be my own man.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope the time will soon come, when, from Canada to the Gulf, there will
      not be a single black who is not his own man. We in the army are doing
      what we can, but we must be backed up by those who stay at home. My own
      feeling is that slavery has received its death-blow. It may continue to
      live for some years, but it has fallen from its pomp and pride of place.
      It is tottering to its fall. What shall be done with the negroes in the
      transition state will be a problem for statesmen to consider. I don't
      think we need fear the consequences of doing right, and on this subject
      there can be no doubt of what is right; The apparent insensibility and
      brutish ignorance which we find among some of the slaves will wear away
      under happier influences.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a little fellow of perhaps a dozen years who comes into our camp
      and runs of errands and does little services for the men. Yesterday
      morning he came to my tent, and with a grin, said to me, 'De ol' man died
      last night.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'What, your father?' I inquired in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Yes, massa,' with another grin: 'Goin' to tote him off dis mornin'.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As he only lived a quarter of a mile off, I got permission to go over to
      the house, or cabin, where Scip's father had lived.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The outer door was open, and I entered without knocking. A woman was
      bending over a washtub at the back part of the room. I looked around me
      for the body, but could see no indication of anything having happened out
      of the ordinary course.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought it possible that Scip had deceived me, and accordingly spoke to
      the woman, inquiring if she was Scip's mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She replied in the affirmative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'And where is his father?' I next inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Oh, he's done dead,' she said, continuing her washing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'When did he die?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Las' night, massa.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'And where is the body?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Toted off, massa, very first t'ing dis mornin'.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In spite of this case of apparent insensibility, the negro's family
      attachments are quite as warm naturally as our own. They have little
      reason, indeed, to mourn over the loss of a husband or father, since, in
      most cases, it is the only portal to the freedom which they covet. The
      separation of families, too, tends, of course, to weaken family ties.
      While I write these words I cannot help recalling our own happy home, and
      longing for an hour, if not more, of your society. I am glad that you find
      Mr. Morton so agreeable an inmate. You ought to feel quite indebted him
      for his assistance in your studies. I am glad you have formed a boy's
      company. It is very desirable that the elements of military science should
      be understood even by boys, since upon them must soon devolve the defense
      of their country from any blows that may be directed against her, whether
      by foes from within or enemies from abroad.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The coming season will be a busy one with you. When you receive this
      letter it will be about time for you to begin to plow whatever land is to
      be planted. As I suggested in my first letter from camp, I should like you
      to devote some space-perhaps half an acre-to the culture of onions. We
      find them very useful for promoting health in the army. They are quite
      high on account of the largely increased demand, so that it will be a good
      crop for financial reasons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      (Here followed some directions with regard to the spring planting, which
      we omit, as not likely to interest our readers.) The letter ended thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is nearly time for me to mail this letter, and it is already much
      longer than I intended to write. May God keep you all in health and
      happiness is the fervent wish of
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your affectionate father,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;HENRY FROST.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The intelligence that their father had been a prisoner made quite a
      sensation among the children. Charlie declared that Mrs. Roberts was a
      wicked woman, and he was glad she was put in prison&mdash;an expression of
      joy in which the rest fully participated.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVII. POMP'S LIGHT INFANTRY TACTICS
    </h2>
    <p>
      Little Pomp continued to pursue his studies under Frank as a teacher. By
      degrees his restlessness diminished, and, finding Frank firm in exacting a
      certain amount of study before he would dismiss him, he concluded that it
      was best to study in earnest, and so obtain the courted freedom as
      speedily as possible. Frank had provided for his use a small chair, which
      he had himself used when at Pomp's age, but for this the little contraband
      showed no great liking. He preferred to throw himself on a rug before the
      open fire-place, and, curling up, not unlike a cat, began to pore over his
      primer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank often looked up from his own studies and looked down with an amused
      glance at little Pomp's coal-back face and glistening eyes riveted upon
      the book before him. There was no lack of brightness or intelligence in
      the earnest face of his young pupil. He seemed to be studying with all his
      might. In a wonderfully short time he would uncoil himself, and, coming to
      his teacher, would say, &ldquo;I guess I can say it, Mass' Frank.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Finding how readily Pomp learned his lessons, Frank judiciously lengthened
      them, so that, in two or three months, Pomp could read words of one
      syllable with considerable ease, and promised very soon to read as well as
      most boys of his age.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank also took considerable pains to cure Pomp of his mischievous
      propensities, but this he found a more difficult task than teaching him to
      read. Pomp had an innate love of fun which seemed almost irrepressible,
      and his convictions of duty sat too lightly upon him to interfere very
      seriously with its gratification. One adventure into which he was led came
      near having serious consequences.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pomp, in common with other village boys of his age, had watched with
      considerable interest the boys 'company, as they drilled publicly or
      paraded through the main street, and he had conceived a strong desire to
      get hold of a musket, to see if he, too, could not go through with the
      manual.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank generally put his musket carefully away, only bringing it out when
      it was needful. One morning, however, he had been out on a
      hunting-expedition, and on his return left the musket in the corner of the
      shed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pomp espied it when he entered the house, and resolved, if possible, to
      take temporary possession of it after his lesson was over. Having this in
      view, he worked with an uncommon degree of industry, and in less time than
      usual had learned and said his lesson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, Pomp,&rdquo; said his teacher approvingly. &ldquo;You have worked
      unusually well to-day. If you keep on you will make quite a scholar some
      day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I's improvin', isn't I?&rdquo; inquired Pomp, with an appearance of interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Pomp, you have improved rapidly. By and by you can teach your mother
      how to read.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She couldn't learn, Mass' Frank. She's poor ignorant nigger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shouldn't speak so of your mother, Pomp. She's a good mother to you,
      and works hard to earn money to support you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Mass' Frank,&rdquo; said Pomp, who was getting impatient to go. &ldquo;I guess
      I'll go home and help her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frank thought that what he had said was producing a good effect. He did
      not know the secret of Pomp's haste.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pomp left the room, and, proceeding to the wood-shed, hastily possessed
      himself of the musket. In a stealthy manner he crept with it through a
      field behind the house, until he got into the neighboring woods.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found it a hard tug to carry the gun, which was heavier than those made
      at the present day. At length he reached an open space in the woods, only
      a few rods from the road which led from the farmhouse, past the shanty
      occupied by old Chloe. As this road was not much traveled, Pomp felt
      pretty safe from discovery, and accordingly here it was that he halted,
      and made preparations to go through the manual.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It begins dis yer way,&rdquo; said Pomp, after a little reflection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grasping the musket with one hand he called out in an important tone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tention, squab!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For the benefit of the uninitiated it may be explained that Pomp meant
      &ldquo;Attention, squad!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;S'port arms!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pomp found it considerably easier to give the word of command than to obey
      it. With some difficulty he succeeded in accomplishing this movement, and
      proceeded with the manual, with several original variations which would
      have astonished a military instructor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, though Pomp did not realize it, he was exposing himself to
      considerable danger. The gun had been loaded with buckshot in the morning,
      and the charge had not been withdrawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to be the lot of poor Mrs. Payson to suffer fright or disaster
      whenever she encountered Pomp, and this memorable afternoon was to make no
      exception to the rule.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cynthy Ann,&rdquo; she said to her daughter, in the afternoon, &ldquo;I guess I'll go
      and spend the arternoon with Mis' Forbes. I hain't been to see her for
      nigh a month, and I calc'late she'll be glad to see me. Besides, she
      ginerally bakes Thursdays, an' mos' likely she'll have some hot
      gingerbread. I'm partic'larly fond of gingerbread, an' she does know how
      to make it about the best of anybody I know on. You needn't wait supper
      for me, Cynthy Ann, for ef I don't find Mis' Forbes to home I'll go on to
      Mis' Frost's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Payson put on her cloak and hood, and, armed with the work-bag and
      the invariable blue cotton umbrella, sallied out. Mrs. Forbes lived at the
      distance of a mile, but Mrs. Payson was a good walker for a woman of her
      age, and less than half an hour brought her to the door of the brown
      farmhouse in which Mrs. Forbes lived.
    </p>
    <p>
      She knocked on the door with the handle of her umbrella. The summons was
      answered by a girl of twelve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How dy do, Betsy?&rdquo; said Mrs. Payson. &ldquo;Is your ma'am to home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, she's gone over to Webbington to spend two or three days with Aunt
      Prudence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then she won't be home to tea,&rdquo; said Mrs. Payson, considerably
      disappointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, ma'am, I don't expect her before to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I declare for't, I am disapp'inted,&rdquo; said the old lady regretfully.
      &ldquo;I've walked a mile on puppus to see her. I'm most tuckered out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won't you step in and sit down?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don't keer ef I do a few minutes. I feel like to drop. Do you do
      the cooking while you maam's gone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, she baked up enough to last before she went away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You hain't got any gingerbread in the house?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Payson, with
      subdued eagerness. &ldquo;I always did say Mis' Forbes beat the world at makin'
      gingerbread.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm very sorry, Mrs. Payson, but we ate the last for supper last night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear!&rdquo; sighed the old lady, &ldquo;I feel sort of faint&mdash;kinder gone
      at the stomach. I didn't have no appetite at dinner, and I s'pose it don't
      agree with me walkin' so fur on an empty stomach.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Couldn't you eat a piece of pie?&rdquo; asked Betsy sympathizingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the old lady reflectively, &ldquo;I don't know but I could eat jest
      a bite. But you needn't trouble yourself. I hate to give trouble to
      anybody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it won't be any trouble,&rdquo; said Betsy cheerfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And while you're about it,&rdquo; added Mrs. Payson, &ldquo;ef you have got any of
      that cider you give me when I was here before, I don't know but I could
      worry down a little of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, we've got plenty. I'll bring it in with the pie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; murmured the old lady, &ldquo;I'll get something for my trouble. I guess
      I'll go and take supper at Mis' Frost's a'terward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Betsy brought in a slice of apple and one of pumpkin pie, and set them
      down before the old lady. In addition she brought a generous mug of cider.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old lady's eyes brightened, as she saw this substantial refreshment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're a good gal, Betsy,&rdquo; she said in the overflow of her emotions. &ldquo;I
      was saying to my darter yesterday that I wish all the gals round here was
      as good and considerate as you be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, Mrs. Payson,&rdquo; said Betsy modestly. &ldquo;I ain't any better than girls
      generally.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you be. There's my granddarter, Jane, ain't so respectful as she'd
      arter be to her old grandma'am. I often tell her that when she gets to
      have children of her own, she'll know what tis to be a pilgrim an' a
      sojourner on the arth without nobody to consider her feelin's. Your cider
      is putty good.&rdquo; Here the old lady took a large draft, and set down the mug
      with a sigh of satisfaction. &ldquo;It's jest the thing to take when a body's
      tired. It goes to the right spot. Cynthy Ann's husband didn't have none
      made this year. I wonder ef your ma would sell a quart or two of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can have it and welcome, Mrs. Payson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I jest as well as not? Well, that's kind. But I didn't expect you to
      give it to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, we have got plenty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dunno how I can carry it home,&rdquo; said the lady hesitatingly. &ldquo;I wonder
      ef some of your folks won't be going up our way within a day or two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will send it. I guess father'll be going up to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then ef you can spare it you might send round a gallon, an' ef there's
      anything to pay I'll pay for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This little business arrangement being satisfactorily adjusted, and the
      pie consumed, Mrs. Payson got up and said she must be going.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid you haven't got rested yet, Mrs. Payson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain't hardly,&rdquo; was the reply; &ldquo;but I guess I shall stop on the way at
      Mis' Frost's. Tell your ma I'll come up an' see her ag'in afore long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, ma'am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' you won't forget to send over that cider?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, ma'am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm ashamed to trouble ye, but their ain't anybody over to our house that
      I can send. There's Tom grudges doin' anything for his old grandma'am.
      A'ter all that I do for him, too! Good-by!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old lady set out on her way to Mrs. Frost's.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her road lay through the woods, where an unforeseen danger lay in wait for
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Pomp was pursuing military science under difficulties. The
      weight of the musket made it very awkward for him to handle. Several times
      he got out of patience with it, and apostrophized it in terms far from
      complimentary. At last, in one of his awkward maneuvers, he accidentally
      pulled the trigger. Instantly there was a loud report, followed by a
      piercing shriek from the road. The charge had entered old Mrs. Payson's
      umbrella and knocked it out of her hand. The old lady fancied herself hit,
      and fell backward, kicking energetically, and screaming &ldquo;murder&rdquo; at the
      top of her lungs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The musket had done double execution. It was too heavily loaded, and as it
      went off, 'kicked,' leaving Pomp, about as scared as the old lady,
      sprawling on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry Morton was only a few rods off when he heard the explosion. He at
      once ran to the old lady's assistance, fancying her hurt. She shrieked the
      louder on his approach, imagining that he was a robber, and had fired at
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go away!&rdquo; she cried, in affright. &ldquo;I ain't got any money. I'm a poor,
      destitute widder!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you take me for?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Morton, somewhat amazed at this
      mode of address.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ain't you a highwayman?&rdquo; asked the old lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you look at me close I think you will be able to answer that question
      for yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old lady cautiously rose to a sitting posture, and, mechanically
      adjusting her spectacles, took a good look at the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I declare for it, ef it ain't Mr. Morton! I thought 'twas you that
      fired at me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you are not hurt,&rdquo; said Mr. Morton, finding a difficulty in
      preserving his gravity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dunno,&rdquo; said the old lady dubiously, pulling up her sleeve, and
      examining her arm. &ldquo;I don't see nothin'; but I expect I've had some injury
      to my inards. I feel as ef I'd had a shock somewhere. Do you think he'll
      fire again?&rdquo; she asked, with a sudden alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You need not feel alarmed,&rdquo; was the soothing reply. &ldquo;It was no doubt an
      accident.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Turning suddenly, he espied Pomp peering from behind a tree, with eyes and
      mouth wide open. The little contraband essayed a hasty flight; but Mr.
      Morton, by a masterly flank movement, came upon him, and brought forward
      the captive kicking and struggling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Le' me go!&rdquo; said Pomp. &ldquo;I ain't done noffin'!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't you fire a gun at this lady?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Pomp boldly. &ldquo;Wish I may be killed ef I did!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know 'twas you&mdash;you&mdash;you imp!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Payson, in
      violent indignation. &ldquo;I seed you do it. You're the wust boy that ever
      lived, and you'll be hung jest as sure as I stan' here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did it happen, Pomp?&rdquo; asked Mr. Morton quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It jest shooted itself!&rdquo; said Pomp, in whom the old lady's words inspired
      a vague feeling of alarm. &ldquo;I 'clare to gracious, Mass' Morton, it did!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't you have the gun in your hand, Pomp? Where did you get it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I jest borrered it of Mass' Frank, to play sojer a little while,&rdquo; said
      Pomp reluctantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he know that you have got it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I 'clare I done forgot to tell him,&rdquo; said Pomp reluctantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you promise never to touch it again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't want to!&rdquo; ejaculated Pomp, adding spitefully, &ldquo;He kick me over!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm glad on't,&rdquo; said the old lady emphatically, with a grim air of
      satisfaction. &ldquo;That'll l'arn you not to fire it off at your elders ag'in.
      I've a great mind to box your ears, and sarve you right, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Payson advanced, to effect her purpose; but Pomp was wary, and,
      adroitly freeing himself from Mr. Morton's grasp, butted at the old lady
      with such force that she would have fallen backward but for the timely
      assistance of Mr. Morton, who sprang to her side. Her bag fell to the
      ground, and she struggled to regain her lost breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; groaned the old lady, gasping for breath, &ldquo;he's mos' knocked the
      breath out of me. I sha'n't live long a'ter such a shock. I'm achin' all
      over. Why did you let him do it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was too quick for me, Mrs. Payson. I hope you feel better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dunno as I shall ever feel any better,&rdquo; said Mrs. Payson gloomily. &ldquo;If
      Cynthy Ann only knew how her poor old ma'am had been treated! I dunno as I
      shall live to get home!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, you will,&rdquo; said the young man cheerfully, &ldquo;and live to see a
      good many years more. Would you like to have me attend you home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain't got strength to go so fur,&rdquo; said Mrs. Payson, who had not given
      up her plan of taking tea out. &ldquo;I guess I could go as fur as Mis' Frost's,
      an' mebbe some on you will tackle up an' carry me back to Cynthy Ann's
      a'ter tea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arrived at the farmhouse, Mrs. Payson indulged in a long detail of
      grievances; but it was observed that they did not materially affect her
      appetite at tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      The offending musket was found by Frank under a tree, where Pomp had
      dropped it when it went off.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVIII. JOHN HAYNES HAS A NARROW ESCAPE
    </h2>
    <p>
      John Haynes found the time hang heavily upon his hand after his withdrawal
      from the boys' volunteer company. All the boys with whom he had been
      accustomed to associate belonged to it, and in their interest could talk
      of nothing else. To him, on the contrary, it was a disagreeable subject.
      In the pleasant spring days the company came out twice a week, and went
      through company drill on the Common, under the command of Frank, or
      Captain Frost, as he was now called.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had Frank shown himself incompetent, and made himself ridiculous by
      blunders, it would have afforded John satisfaction. But Frank, thorough in
      all things, had so carefully prepared himself for his duties that he never
      made a mistake, and always acquitted himself so creditably and with such
      entire self-possession, that his praises were in every mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dick Bumstead, too, manifested an ambition to fill his second lieutenancy,
      to which, so much to his own surprise, he had been elected, in such a
      manner as to justify the company in their choice. In this he fully
      succeeded. He had become quite a different boy from what he was when we
      first made his acquaintance. He had learned to respect himself, and
      perceived with great satisfaction that he was generally respected by the
      boys. He no longer attempted to shirk his work in the shop, and his father
      now spoke of him with complacency, instead of complaint as formerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he one day, &ldquo;Dick's a good boy. He was always smart, but
      rather fly-a-way. I couldn't place any dependence upon him once, but it is
      not so now. I couldn't wish for a better boy. I don't know what has come
      over him, but I hope it'll last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dick happened to overhear his father speaking thus to a neighbor, and he
      only determined, with a commendable feeling of pride, that the change that
      had given his father so much pleasure should last. It does a boy good to
      know that his efforts are appreciated. In this case it had a happy effect
      upon Dick, who, I am glad to say, kept his resolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has been mentioned that John was the possessor of a boat. Finding one
      great source of amusement cut off, and being left very much to himself, he
      fell back upon this, and nearly every pleasant afternoon he might be seen
      rowing on the river above the dam. He was obliged to confine himself to
      this part of the river, since, in the part below the dam, the water was
      too shallow.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is one great drawback, however, upon the pleasure of owning a
      rowboat. It is tiresome to row single-handed after a time. So John found
      it, and, not being overfond of active exertion, he was beginning to get
      weary of this kind of amusement when all at once a new plan was suggested
      to him. This was, to rig up a mast and sail, and thus obviate the
      necessity of rowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      No sooner had this plan suggested itself than he hastened to put it into
      execution. His boat was large enough to bear a small mast, so there was no
      difficulty on that head. He engaged the village carpenter to effect the
      desired change. He did not choose to consult his father on the subject,
      fearing that he might make some objection either on score of safety or
      expense, while he had made up his mind to have his own way.
    </p>
    <p>
      When it was finished, and the boat with its slender mast and white sail
      floated gently on the quiet bosom of the stream, John's satisfaction was
      unbounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've got a pretty boat,&rdquo; said Mr. Plane, the carpenter. &ldquo;I suppose you
      know how to manage it?&rdquo; he added inquiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered John carelessly, &ldquo;I've been in a sailboat before to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Plane's doubts were set at rest by John's confident manner, and he
      suppressed the caution which he had intended to give him. It made little
      difference, however, for John was headstrong, and would have been pretty
      certain to disregard whatever he might say.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was true that this was not the first time John had been in a sailboat;
      but if not the first, it was only the second. The first occasion had been
      three years previous, and at that time he had had nothing to do with the
      management of the boat&mdash;a very important matter. It was in John's
      nature to be over-confident, and he thought he understood merely from
      observation exactly how a boat ought to be managed. As we shall see, he
      found out his mistake.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first day after his boat was ready John was greatly disappointed that
      there was no wind. The next day, as if to make up for it, the wind was
      very strong. Had John possessed a particle of prudence he would have seen
      that it was no day to venture out in a sailboat. But he was not in the
      habit of curbing his impatience, and he determined that he would not wait
      till another day. He declared that it was a mere &ldquo;capful of wind,&rdquo; and
      would be all the better for the purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a tip-top wind. Won't it make my boat scud,&rdquo; he said to himself
      exultantly, as he took his place, and pushed off from shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry Morton had been out on a walk, and from the summit of a little hill
      near the river-bank espied John pushing off in his boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He'll be sure to capsize,&rdquo; thought the young man in alarm. &ldquo;Even if he is
      used to a sailboat he is very imprudent to put out in such a wind; I will
      hurry down and save him if I can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He hurried to the bank of the river, reaching it out of breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      John was by this time some distance out. The wind had carried him along
      finely, the boat scudding, as he expressed it. He was congratulating
      himself on the success of his trial trip, when all at once a flaw struck
      the boat. Not being a skillful boatman he was wholly unprepared for it,
      and the boat upset.
    </p>
    <p>
      Struggling in terror and confusion, John struck out for the shore. But he
      was not much of a swimmer, and the suddenness of the accident had unnerved
      him, and deprived him of his self-possession. The current of the river was
      rapid, and he would inevitably have drowned but for the opportune
      assistance of Mr. Morton.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man had no sooner seen the boat capsize, than he flung off his
      coat and boots, and, plunging into the river, swam vigorously toward the
      imperiled boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Luckily for John, Mr. Morton was, though of slight frame, muscular, and an
      admirable swimmer. He reached him just as John's strokes were becoming
      feebler and feebler; he was about to give up his unequal struggle with the
      waves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take hold of me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Have courage, and I will save you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John seized him with the firm grip of a drowning person, and nearly
      prevented him from striking out. But Mr. Morton's strength served him in
      good stead; and, notwithstanding the heavy burden, he succeeded in
      reaching the bank in safety, though with much exhaustion.
    </p>
    <p>
      John no sooner reached the bank than he fainted away. The great danger
      which he had just escaped, added to his own efforts, had proved too much
      for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Morton, fortunately knew how to act in such emergencies. By the use of
      the proper remedies, he was fortunately brought to himself, and his
      preserver offered to accompany him home. John still felt giddy, and was
      glad to accept Mr. Morton's offer. He knew that his father would be angry
      with him for having the boat fitted up without his knowledge, especially
      as he had directed Mr. Plane to charge it to his father's account.
      Supposing that Squire Haynes approved, the carpenter made no objections to
      doing so. But even the apprehension of his father's anger was swallowed up
      by the thought of the great peril from which he had just escaped, and the
      discomfort of the wet clothes which he had on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Morton, too, was completely wet through, with the exception of his
      coat, and but for John's apparent inability to go home alone, would at
      once have returned to his boarding-house to exchange his wet clothes for
      dry ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      It so happened that Squire Haynes was sitting at a front window, and saw
      Mr. Morton and his son as they entered the gate and came up the graveled
      walk. He had never met Mr. Morton, and was surprised now at seeing him in
      John's company. He had conceived a feeling of dislike to the young man,
      for which he could not account, while at the same time he felt a strong
      curiosity to know more of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they came nearer, he perceived the drenched garments, and went to the
      door himself to admit them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter, John?&rdquo; he demanded hastily, with a contraction of the
      eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm wet!&rdquo; said John shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is easy to see that. But how came you so wet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've been in the river,&rdquo; answered John, who did not seem disposed to
      volunteer any particulars of his adventure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How came you there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your son's boat capsized,&rdquo; explained Mr. Morton; &ldquo;and, as you will judge
      from my appearance, I jumped in after him. I should advise him to change
      his clothing, or he will be likely to take cold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Squire Haynes looked puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't see how a large rowboat like his could capsize,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;he
      must have been very careless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a sailboat,&rdquo; explained John, rather reluctantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A sailboat! Whose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't understand at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had a mast put in, and a sail rigged up, two or three days since,&rdquo; said
      John, compelled at last to explain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you do this without my permission?&rdquo; demanded the squire angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said Mr. Morton quietly, &ldquo;it will be better to postpone
      inquiries until your son has changed his clothes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Squire Haynes, though somewhat irritated by this interference, bethought
      himself that it would be churlish not to thank his son's preserver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am indebted to you, sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for your agency in saving the life
      of this rash boy. I regret that you should have got wet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall probably experience nothing more than temporary inconvenience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have been some months in the village, I believe, Mr. Morton. I trust
      you will call at an early day, and enable me to follow up the chance which
      has made us acquainted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I seldom make calls,&rdquo; said Mr. Morton, in a distant tone. &ldquo;Yet,&rdquo; added
      he, after a pause, &ldquo;I may have occasion to accept your invitation some
      day. Good morning, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; returned the squire, looking after him with an expression
      of perplexity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He boards at the Frosts', doesn't he, John?&rdquo; asked Squire Haynes, turning
      to his son.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's something in his face that seems familiar,&rdquo; mused the squire
      absently. &ldquo;He reminds me of somebody, though I can't recall who.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was not long before the squire's memory was refreshed, and he obtained
      clearer information respecting the young man, and the errand which had
      brought him to Rossville. When that information came, it was so far from
      pleasing that he would willingly have postponed it indefinitely.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIX. MR. MORTON'S STORY
    </h2>
    <p>
      The planting-season was over. For a month Frank had worked industriously,
      in conjunction with Jacob Carter. His father had sent him directions so
      full and minute, that he was not often obliged to call upon Farmer Maynard
      for advice. The old farmer proved to be very kind and obliging. Jacob,
      too, was capable and faithful, so that the farm work went on as well
      probably as if Mr. Frost had been at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening toward the middle of June, Frank walked out into the fields
      with Mr. Morton. The corn and potatoes were looking finely. The garden
      vegetables were up, and to all appearance doing well. Frank surveyed the
      scene with a feeling of natural pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you think I would make a successful farmer, Mr. Morton?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Frank; and more than this, I think you will be likely to succeed in
      any other vocation you may select.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid you're flattering me, Mr. Morton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such is not my intention, Frank, but I like to award praise where I think
      it due. I have noticed in you a disposition to be faithful to whatever
      responsibility is imposed upon you, and wherever I see that I feel no
      hesitation in predicting a successful career.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Frank, looking very much pleased with the compliment. &ldquo;I
      try to be faithful. I feel that father has trusted me more than it is
      usual to trust boys of my age, and I want to show myself worthy of his
      confidence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are fortunate in having a father, Frank,&rdquo; said the young man, with a
      shade of sadness in his voice. &ldquo;My father died before I was of your age.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you remember him?&rdquo; inquired Frank, with interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember him well. He was always kind to me. I never remember to have
      received a harsh word from him. It is because he was so kind and indulgent
      to me that I feel the more incensed against a man who took advantage of
      his confidence to defraud him, or, rather, me, through him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have never mentioned this before, Mr. Morton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I have left you all in ignorance of much of my history. This morning,
      if it will interest you, I propose to take you into my confidence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The eagerness with which Frank greeted this proposal showed that for him
      the story would have no lack of interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us sit down under this tree,&rdquo; said Henry Morton, pointing to a
      horse-chestnut, whose dense foliage promised a pleasant shelter from the
      sun's rays.
    </p>
    <p>
      They threw themselves upon the grass, and he forthwith commenced his
      story.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father was born in Boston, and, growing up, engaged in mercantile
      pursuits. He was moderately successful, and finally accumulated fifty
      thousand dollars. He would not have stopped there, for he was at the time
      making money rapidly, but his health became precarious, and his physician
      required him absolutely to give up business. The seeds of consumption,
      which probably had been lurking for years in his system, had begun to show
      themselves unmistakably, and required immediate attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the advice of his physician he sailed for the West India Islands,
      hoping that the climate might have a beneficial effect upon him. At that
      time I was twelve years old, and an only child. My mother had died some
      years before, so that I was left quite alone in the world. I was sent for
      a time to Virginia, to my mother's brother, who possessed a large
      plantation and numerous slaves. Here I remained for six months. You will
      remember that Aunt Chloe recognized me at first sight. You will not be
      surprised at this when I tell you that she was my uncle's slave, and that
      as a boy I was indebted to her for many a little favor which she, being
      employed in the kitchen, was able to render me. As I told you at the time,
      my real name is not Morton. It will not be long before you understand the
      reason of my concealment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father had a legal adviser, in whom he reposed a large measure of
      confidence, though events showed him to be quite unworthy of it. On
      leaving Boston he divided his property, which had been converted into
      money, into two equal portions. One part he took with him. The other he
      committed to the lawyer's charge. So much confidence had he in this man's
      honor, that he did not even require a receipt. One additional safeguard he
      had, however. This was the evidence of the lawyer's clerk, who was present
      on the occasion of the deposit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father went to the West Indies, but the change seemed only to
      accelerate the progress of his malady. He lingered for a few months and
      then died. Before his death he wrote two letters, one to my uncle and one
      to myself. In these he communicated the fact of his having deposited
      twenty-five thousand dollars with his lawyer. He mentioned incidentally
      the presence of the lawyer's clerk at the time. I am a little surprised
      that he should have done it, as not the faintest suspicion of the lawyer's
      good faith had entered his thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On receiving this letter my uncle, on my behalf, took measures to claim
      this sum, and for this purpose came to Boston. Imagine his surprise and
      indignation when the lawyer positively denied having received any such
      deposit and called upon him, to prove it. With great effrontery he
      declared that it was absurd to suppose that my father would have entrusted
      him with any such sum without a receipt for it. This certainly looked
      plausible, and I acknowledge that few except my father, who never trusted
      without trusting entirely, would have acted so imprudently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Where is the clerk who was in your office at the time?&rdquo; inquired my
      uncle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lawyer looked somewhat discomposed at this question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Why do you ask?' he inquired abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Because,' was the reply, 'his evidence is very important to us. My
      brother states that he was present when the deposit was made.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I don't know where he is,' said the lawyer. 'He was too dissipated to
      remain in my office, and I accordingly discharged him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My uncle suspected that the clerk had been bribed to keep silence, and
      for additional security sent off to some distant place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing could be done. Strong as our suspicions, and absolute as was our
      conviction of the lawyer's guilt, we had no recourse. But from that time I
      devoted my life to the exposure of this man. Fortunately I was not without
      means. The other half of my father's property came to me; and the interest
      being considerably more than I required for my support, I have devoted the
      remainder to, prosecuting inquiries respecting the missing clerk. Just
      before I came to Rossville, I obtained a clue which I have since
      industriously followed up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Last night I received a letter from my agent, stating that he had found
      the man&mdash;that he was in a sad state of destitution, and that he was
      ready to give his evidence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the lawyer still living?&rdquo; inquired Frank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a villain he must be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid he is, Frank.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he still live in Boston?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. After he made sure of his ill-gotten gains, he removed into the
      country, where he built him a fine house. He has been able to live a life
      of leisure; but I doubt if he has been as happy as he would have been had
      he never deviated from the path of rectitude.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you seen him lately?&rdquo; asked Frank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have seen him many times within the last few months,&rdquo; said the young
      man, in a significant tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank jumped to his feet in surprise. &ldquo;You don't mean&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he
      said, as a sudden suspicion of the truth dawned upon his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mr. Morton deliberately, &ldquo;I do mean that the lawyer who
      defrauded my father lives in this village. You know him well as Squire
      Haynes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can hardly believe it,&rdquo; said Frank, unable to conceal his astonishment.
      &ldquo;Do you think he knows who you are?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think he has noticed my resemblance to my father. If I had not assumed
      a different name he would have been sure to detect me. This would have
      interfered with my plans, as he undoubtedly knew the whereabouts of his
      old clerk, and would have arranged to remove him, so as to delay his
      discovery, perhaps indefinitely. Here is the letter I received last night.
      I will read it to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The letter ran as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have at length discovered the man of whom I have so long been in
      search. I found him in Detroit. He had recently removed thither from St.
      Louis. He is very poor, and, when I found him, was laid up with typhoid
      fever in a mean lodging-house. I removed him to more comfortable quarters,
      supplied him with relishing food and good medical assistance. Otherwise I
      think he would have died. The result is, that he feels deeply grateful to
      me for having probably saved his life. When I first broached the idea of
      his giving evidence against his old employer, I found him reluctant to do
      so&mdash;not from any attachment he bore him, but from a fear that he
      would be held on a criminal charge for concealing a felony. I have
      undertaken to assure him, on your behalf, that he shall not be punished if
      he will come forward and give his evidence unhesitatingly. I have finally
      obtained his promise to, do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall leave Detroit day after to-morrow, and proceed to New England by
      way of New York. Can you meet me in New York on the 18th inst.? You can,
      in that case, have an interview with this man Travers; and it Will be well
      to obtain his confession, legally certified, to guard against any
      vacillation of purpose on his part. I have no apprehension of it, but it
      is as well to be certain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This letter was signed by Mr. Morton's agent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was very glad to get that letter, Frank,&rdquo; said his companion. &ldquo;I don't
      think I care so much for the money, though that is not to be despised,
      since it will enable me to do more good than at present I have it in my
      power to do. But there is one thing I care for still more, and that is, to
      redeem my father's memory from reproach. In the last letter he ever wrote
      he made a specific statement, which this lawyer declares to be false. The
      evidence of his clerk will hurl back the falsehood upon himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How strange it is, Mr. Morton,&rdquo; exclaimed Frank, &ldquo;that you should have
      saved the life of a son of the man who has done so much to injure you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that gives me great satisfaction. I do not wish Squire Haynes any
      harm, but I am determined that justice shall be done. Otherwise than that,
      if I can be of any service to him, I shall not refuse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember now,&rdquo; said Frank, after a moment's pause, &ldquo;that, on the first
      Sunday you appeared at church, Squire Haynes stopped me to inquire who you
      were.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am thought to look much as my father did. He undoubtedly saw the
      resemblance. I have often caught his eyes fixed upon me in perplexity when
      he did not know that I noticed him. It is fourteen years since my father
      died. Retribution has been slow, but it has come at last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When do you go on to New York?&rdquo; asked Frank, recalling the agent's
      request.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall start to-morrow morning. For the present I will ask you to keep
      what I have said a secret even from your good mother. It is as well not to
      disturb Squire Haynes in his fancied security until we are ready to
      overwhelm him with our evidence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long shall you be absent, Mr. Morton?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably less than a week. I shall merely say that I have gone on
      business. I trust to your discretion to say nothing more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I certainly will not,&rdquo; said Frank. &ldquo;I am very much obliged to you for
      having told me first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two rose from their grassy seats, and walked slowly back to the
      farmhouse.

      CHAPTER XXX. FRANK CALLS ON SQUIRE HAYNES
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next morning Mr. Morton was a passenger by the early stage for
      Webbington, where he took the train for Boston. Thence he was to proceed
      to New York by the steamboat train.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-by, Mr. Morton,&rdquo; said Frank, waving his cap as the stage started. &ldquo;I
      hope you'll soon be back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope so, too; good-by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Crack went the whip, round went the wheels. The horses started, and the
      stage rumbled off, swaying this way and that, as if top-heavy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank went slowly back to the house, feeling quite lonely. He had become
      so accustomed to Mr. Morton's companionship that his departure left a void
      which he hardly knew how to fill.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he reflected upon Mr. Morton's story he began to feel an increased
      uneasiness at the mortgage held by Squire Haynes upon his father's farm.
      The time was very near at hand&mdash;only ten days off&mdash;when the
      mortgage might be foreclosed, and but half the money was in readiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps, however, Squire Haynes had no intention of foreclosing. If so,
      there was no occasion for apprehension. But about this he felt by no means
      certain.
    </p>
    <p>
      He finally determined, without consulting his mother, to make the squire a
      visit and inquire frankly what he intended to do. The squire's answer
      would regulate his future proceedings.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Frank's rule&mdash;and a very good one, too&mdash;to do at once
      whatever needed to be done. He resolved to lose no time in making his
      call.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frank,&rdquo; said his mother, as he entered the house, &ldquo;I want you to go down
      to the store some time this forenoon, and get me half a dozen pounds of
      sugar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, mother, I'll go now. I suppose it won't make any difference if
      I don't come back for an hour or two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, that will be in time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Frost did not ask Frank where he was going. She had perfect faith in
      him, and felt sure that he would never become involved in anything
      discreditable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank passed through the village without stopping at the store. He
      deferred his mother's errand until his return. Passing up the village
      street, he stopped before the fine house of Squire Haynes. Opening the
      gate he walked up the graveled path and rang the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      A servant-girl came to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Squire Haynes at home?&rdquo; inquired Frank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but he's eating breakfast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will he be through soon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shure and I think so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I will step in and wait for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who shall I say it is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frank Frost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Squire Haynes had just passed his cup for coffee when Bridget entered and
      reported that Frank Frost was in the drawing-room and would like to see
      him when he had finished his breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frank Frost!&rdquo; repeated the squire, arching his eyebrows. &ldquo;What does he
      want, I wonder?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shure he didn't say,&rdquo; said Bridget.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is captain of the boys' company, John, isn't he?&rdquo; asked the squire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said John sulkily. &ldquo;I wish him joy of his office. I wouldn't have
      anything to do with such a crowd of ragamuffins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Of course the reader understands that this was &ldquo;sour grapes&rdquo; on John's
      part.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finishing his breakfast leisurely, Squire Haynes went into the room where
      Frank was sitting patiently awaiting him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank rose as he entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning, Squire Haynes,&rdquo; he said, politely rising as he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; said the squire coldly. &ldquo;You are an early visitor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If this was intended for a rebuff, Frank did not choose to take any notice
      of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I call on a little matter of business, Squire Haynes,&rdquo; continued Frank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said the squire, seating himself in a luxurious armchair, &ldquo;I
      am ready to attend to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you hold a mortgage on our farm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Squire Haynes started. The thought of Frank's real business had not
      occurred to him. He had hoped that nothing would have been said in
      relation to the mortgage until he was at liberty to foreclose, as he
      wished to take the Frosts unprepared. He now resolved, if possible, to
      keep Frank in ignorance of his real purpose, that he might not think it
      necessary to prepare for his attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he indifferently; &ldquo;I hold quite a number of mortgages, and one
      upon your father's farm among them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't the time nearly run out?&rdquo; asked Frank anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can look if you desire it,&rdquo; said the squire, in the same indifferent
      tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should be glad if you would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I ask why you are desirous of ascertaining the precise date?&rdquo; asked
      the squire. &ldquo;Are you intending to pay off the mortgage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; said Frank. &ldquo;We are not prepared to do so at present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Squire Haynes felt relieved. He feared for a moment that Mr. Frost had
      secured the necessary sum, and that he would be defeated in his wicked
      purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew out a large number of papers, which he rather ostentatiously
      scattered about the table, and finally came to the mortgage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The mortgage comes due on the first of July,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will it be convenient for you to renew it, Squire Haynes?&rdquo; asked Frank
      anxiously. &ldquo;Father being absent, it would be inconvenient for us to obtain
      the amount necessary to cancel it. Of course, I shall be ready to pay the
      interest promptly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unless I should have sudden occasion for the money,&rdquo; said the squire, &ldquo;I
      will let it remain. I don't think you need feel any anxiety on the
      subject.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With the intention of putting Frank off his guard, Squire Haynes assumed a
      comparatively gracious tone. This, in the case of any other man, would
      have completely reassured Frank. But he had a strong distrust of the
      squire, since the revelation of his character made by his friend Mr.
      Morton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could you tell me positively?&rdquo; he asked, still uneasy. &ldquo;It is only ten
      days now to the first of July, and that is little enough to raise the
      money in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't trouble yourself,&rdquo; said the squire. &ldquo;I said unless I had sudden
      occasion for the money, because unforeseen circumstances might arise. But
      as I have a considerable sum lying at the bank, I don't anticipate
      anything of the kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you will give me immediate notice, should it be necessary. We
      can pay four hundred dollars now. So, if you please, the new mortgage can
      be made out for half the present amount.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said the squire carelessly. &ldquo;Just as you please as to that.
      Still, as you have always paid my interest regularly, I consider the
      investment a good one, and have no objection to the whole remaining.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, sir,&rdquo; said Frank, rising to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank took his hat, and, bowing to the squire, sought the front door. His
      face wore a perplexed expression. He hardly knew what to think about the
      interview he had just had.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Squire Haynes talks fair enough,&rdquo; he soliloquized; &ldquo;and, perhaps, he
      means what he says. If it hadn't been for what Mr. Morton told me, I
      should have confidence in him. But a man who will betray a trust is
      capable of breaking his word to me. I think I'll look round a little, and
      see if I can't provide for the worse in case it comes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just after Frank left the house, John entered his father's presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did Frank Frost want of you, father?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He came about the mortgage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he want to pay it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he wants me to renew it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you refused.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I did no such thing. Do you think I am a fool?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't mean to say that you agreed to renew it?&rdquo; demanded John, in
      angry amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Squire Haynes rather enjoyed John's mystification.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I'm afraid you'll never make a lawyer if you're not
      sharper than that comes to. Never reveal your plans to your adversary.
      That's an important principle. If I had refused, he would have gone to
      work, and in ten days between now and the first of July, he'd have managed
      in some way to scrape together the eight hundred dollars. He's got half of
      it now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you tell him, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I put him off by telling him not to trouble himself&mdash;that I would
      not foreclose the mortgage unless I had unexpected occasion for the
      money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I see,&rdquo; said John, his face brightening at the anticipated disaster
      to the Frosts. &ldquo;You'll take care that there shall be some sudden
      occasion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the squire complacently. &ldquo;I'll have a note come due, which I
      had not thought about, or something of the kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that'll be bully.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't use such low words, John. I have repeatedly requested you to be
      more careful about your language. By the way, your teacher told me
      yesterday that you are not doing as well now as formerly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he's an old muff. Besides, he's got a spite against me. I should do a
      good deal better at another school.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll see about that. But I suspect he's partly right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, how can a feller study when he knows the teacher is determined to
      be down upon him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Feller!' I am shocked at hearing you use that word. 'Down upon him,'
      too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well; let me go where I won't hear such language spoken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It would have been well if Squire Haynes had been as much shocked by bad
      actions as by low language.
    </p>
    <p>
      This little disagreement over, they began again to anticipate with
      pleasure the effect of the squire's premeditated blow upon the Frosts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll come up with 'em?&rdquo; said John, with inward exultation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, though the squire was entirely unconscious of it, there was a
      sword hanging over his own head.

      CHAPTER XXXI. SQUIRE HAYNES SPRINGS HIS TRAP
    </h2>
    <p>
      As intimated in the last chapter, Frank determined to see if he could not
      raise the money necessary to pay off the mortgage in case it should be
      necessary to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Farmer Maynard was a man in very good circumstances. He owned an excellent
      farm, which yielded more than enough to support his family. Probably he
      had one or two thousand dollars laid aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think he will help me,&rdquo; Frank said to himself, &ldquo;I'll go to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went to the house, and was directed to the barn. There he found the
      farmer engaged in mending a hoe-handle, which had been broken, by splicing
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He unfolded his business. The farmer listened attentively to his
      statement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say the squire as much as told you that he would renew the mortgage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I wouldn't trouble myself then; I've no doubt he'll do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said, unless he should have some sudden occasion for the money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. He is a prudent man, and don't want to bind himself. That is
      all. You know the most unlikely things may happen; but I don't believe the
      squire'll want the money. He's got plenty in the bank.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if he should?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he'll wait, or take part. I suppose you can pay part.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, half.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I guess there won't be any chance of anything going wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If there should,&rdquo; persisted Frank, &ldquo;could you lend us four hundred
      dollars to make up the amount?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd do it in a minute, Frank, but I hain't got the money by me. What
      money I have got besides the farm is lent out in notes. Only last week I
      let my brother-in-law have five hundred dollars, and that leaves me pretty
      short.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps somebody else will advance the money,&rdquo; said Frank, feeling a
      little discouraged at the result of his first application.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, most likely. But I guess you won't need any assistance. I look upon
      it as certain that the mortgage will be renewed. Next fall I shall have
      the money, and if the squire wants to dispose of the mortgage, I shall be
      ready to take it off his hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frank tried to feel that he was foolish in apprehending trouble from
      Squire Haynes, but he found it impossible to rid himself of a vague
      feeling of uneasiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made application to another farmer&mdash;an intimate friend of his
      father's&mdash;but he had just purchased and paid for a five-acre lot
      adjoining his farm, and that had stripped him of money. He, too, bade
      Frank lay aside all anxiety, and assured him that his fears were
      groundless.
    </p>
    <p>
      With this Frank had to be content.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I am foolish,&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;I'll try to think no more
      about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He accordingly returned to his usual work, and, not wishing to trouble his
      mother to no purpose, resolved not to impart his fears to her. Another
      ground of relief suggested itself to him. Mr. Morton would probably be
      back on the 27th of June. Such, at least, was his anticipation when he
      went away. There was reason to believe that he would be both ready and
      willing to take up the mortgage, if needful. This thought brought back
      Frank's cheerfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was somewhat dashed by the following letter which he received a day or
      two later from his absent friend. It was dated New York, June 25, 1863. As
      will appear from its tenor, it prepared Frank for a further delay in Mr.
      Morton's arrival.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DEAR FRANK: I shall not be with you quite as soon as I intended. I hope,
      however, to return a day or two afterward at latest. My business is going
      on well, and I am assured of final success. Will you ask your mother if
      she can accommodate an acquaintance of mine for a day or two? I shall
      bring him with me from New York, and shall feel indebted for the
      accommodation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your true friend,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;HENRY MORTON.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frank understood at once that the acquaintance referred to must be the
      clerk, whose evidence was so important to Mr. Morton's case. Being
      enjoined to secrecy, however, he, of course, felt that he was not at
      liberty to mention this.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day succeeded another until at length the morning of the thirtieth of
      June dawned. Mr. Morton had not yet arrived; but, on the other hand,
      nothing had been heard from Squire Haynes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank began to breathe more freely. He persuaded himself that he had been
      foolishly apprehensive. &ldquo;The squire means to renew the mortgage,&rdquo; he said
      to himself hopefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had a talk with his mother, and she agreed that it would be well to pay
      the four hundred dollars they could spare, and have a new mortgage made
      out for the balance. Frank accordingly rode over to Brandon in the
      forenoon, and withdrew from the bank the entire sum there deposited to his
      father's credit. This, with money which had been received from Mr. Morton
      in payment of his board, made up the requisite amount.
    </p>
    <p>
      About four o'clock in the afternoon, as Mrs. Frost was sewing at a front
      window, she exclaimed to Frank, who was making a kite for his little
      brother Charlie, &ldquo;Frank, there's Squire Haynes coming up the road.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frank's heart gave an anxious bound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he coming here?&rdquo; he asked, with anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mrs. Frost, after a moment's pause. Frank turned pale with
      apprehension.
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment afterward the huge knocker was heard to sound, and Mrs. Frost,
      putting down her work, smoothed her apron and went to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good afternoon, Mrs. Frost,&rdquo; said the squire, lifting his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good afternoon, Squire Haynes. Won't you walk in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you; I will intrude for a few minutes. How do you do?&rdquo; he said,
      nodding to Frank as he entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty well, thank you, sir,&rdquo; said Frank nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      The squire, knowing the odium which would attach to the course he had
      settled upon, resolved to show the utmost politeness to the family he was
      about to injure, and justify his action by the plea of necessity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take a seat, Squire Haynes,&rdquo; said Mrs. Frost &ldquo;You'll find this
      rocking-chair more comfortable.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very well seated, thank you. I cannot stop long. I have merely
      called on a matter of business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About the mortgage?&rdquo; interrupted Frank, who could keep silence no longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely so. I regret to say that I have urgent occasion for the money,
      and shall be unable to renew it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have got four hundred dollars,&rdquo; said Mrs. Frost, &ldquo;which we are
      intending to pay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry to say that this will not answer my purpose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you not let us know before?&rdquo; asked Frank abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frank!&rdquo; said his mother reprovingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was only this morning that the necessity arose. I have a note due
      which must be paid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are not provided with the money, Squire Haynes,&rdquo; said Mrs. Frost. &ldquo;if,
      however, you will wait a few days, we can probably raise it among our
      friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I regret to say that this will not do,&rdquo; said the squire, &ldquo;I would gladly
      postpone the matter. The investment has been satisfactory to me, but
      necessity knows no law.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frank was about to burst out with some indignant exclamation, but his
      mother, checking him, said: &ldquo;I think there is little chance of our being
      able to pay you to-morrow. May I inquire what course you propose to take?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be my painful duty to foreclose the mortgage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Squire Haynes,&rdquo; said Frank boldly, &ldquo;haven't you intended to foreclose the
      mortgage all along? Hadn't you decided about it when I called upon you ten
      days ago?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by your impertinence, sir?&rdquo; demanded the squire, giving
      vent to his anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just what I say. I believe you bear a grudge against my father, and only
      put me off the other day in order to prevent my being able to meet your
      demands to-morrow. What do you suppose we can do in less than twenty-four
      hours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam!&rdquo; said the squire, purple with rage, &ldquo;do you permit your son to
      insult me in this manner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I leave it to your conscience, Squire Haynes, whether his charges are not
      deserved. I do not like to think ill of any man, but your course is very
      suspicious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; said Squire Haynes, now thoroughly enraged, &ldquo;you are a woman, and
      can say what you please; but as for this young rascal, I'll beat him
      within an inch of his life if I ever catch him out of your presence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is under the protection of the laws,&rdquo; said Mrs. Frost composedly,
      &ldquo;which you, being a lawyer, ought to understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll have no mercy on you. I'll sell you up root and branch,&rdquo; said Squire
      Haynes, trembling with passion, and smiting the floor with his cane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At all events the house is ours to-day,&rdquo; returned Mrs. Frost, with
      dignity, &ldquo;and I must request you to leave us in quiet possession of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The squire left the house in undignified haste, muttering threats as he
      went.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good, mother!&rdquo; exclaimed Frank admiringly. &ldquo;You turned him out capitally.
      But,&rdquo; he added, an expression of dismay stealing over his face, &ldquo;what
      shall we do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must try to obtain a loan,&rdquo; said Mrs. Frost, &ldquo;I will go and see Mr.
      Sanger, while you go to Mr. Perry. Possibly they may help us. There is no
      time to be lost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An hour afterward Frank and his mother returned, both disappointed. Mr.
      Sanger and Mr. Perry both had the will to help but not the ability. There
      seemed no hope left save in Mr. Morton. At six o'clock the stage rolled up
      to the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank Heaven! Mr. Morton has come!&rdquo; exclaimed Frank eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Morton got out of the stage, and with him a feeble old man, or such he
      seemed, whom the young man assisted to alight. They came up the gravel
      walk together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do, Frank?&rdquo; he said, with a cheerful smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are in trouble,&rdquo; said Frank. &ldquo;Squire Haynes is going to foreclose the
      mortgage to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind!&rdquo; said Mr. Morton. &ldquo;We will be ready for him. He can't do
      either of us any more mischief, Frank. His race is about run.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A heavy weight seemed lifted from Frank's heart. For the rest of the day
      he was in wild spirits. He asked no questions of Mr. Morton. He felt a
      firm confidence that all would turn out for the best.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXII. TURNING THE TABLES
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next morning Mr. Morton made inquiries of Frank respecting the
      mortgage. Frank explained that a loan of four hundred dollars would enable
      him to cancel it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is very easily arranged, then,&rdquo; said Henry Morton.
    </p>
    <p>
      He opened his pocketbook and drew out four crisp new United States notes,
      of one hundred dollars each.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, Frank,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;that will loosen the hold Squire Haynes has upon
      you. I fancy he will find it a little more difficult to extricate himself
      from my grasp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can I ever thank you, Mr. Morton?&rdquo; said Frank, with emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It gives me great pleasure to have it in my power to be of service to
      you, Frank,&rdquo; said his friend kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will have a mortgage made out to you,&rdquo; continued Frank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not without my consent, I hope,&rdquo; said Mr. Morton, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank looked puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Frank,&rdquo; resumed Mr. Morton, &ldquo;I don't care for any security. You may
      give me a simple acknowledgment of indebtedness, and then pay me at your
      leisure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frank felt with Justice that Mr. Morton was acting very generously, and he
      was more than ever drawn to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      So passed the earlier hours of the forenoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      About eleven o'clock Squire Haynes was observed approaching the house. His
      step was firm and elastic, as if he rejoiced in the errand he was upon.
      Again he lifted the knocker, and sounded a noisy summons. It was in
      reality a summons to surrender.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door was opened again by Mrs. Frost, who invited the squire to enter.
      He did so, wondering at her apparent composure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They can't have raised the money,&rdquo; thought he apprehensively. &ldquo;No, I am
      sure the notice was too short.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frank was in the room, but Squire Haynes did not deign to notice him, nor
      did Frank choose to make advances. Mrs. Frost spoke upon indifferent
      subjects, being determined to force Squire Haynes to broach himself the
      business that had brought him to the farm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, clearing his throat, he said: &ldquo;Well, madam, are you prepared to
      cancel the mortgage which I hold upon your husband's farm?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; said Mrs. Frost, &ldquo;you will give us time. It is hardly possible
      to obtain so large a sum in twenty-four hours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They haven't got it,&rdquo; thought the squire exultingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As to that,&rdquo; he said aloud, &ldquo;you've had several years to get ready in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you no consideration? Remember my husband's absence, and I am
      unacquainted with business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have already told you,&rdquo; said the squire hastily, &ldquo;that I require the
      money. I have a note to pay, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you give us a week?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I must have the money at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if we cannot pay?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must foreclose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will that give you the money any sooner? I suppose you would have to
      advertise the farm for sale before you could realize anything, and I
      hardly think that car be accomplished sooner than a week hence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The delay is only a subterfuge on your part,&rdquo; said the squire hotly. &ldquo;You
      would be no better prepared at the end of a week than you are now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, perhaps not,&rdquo; said Mrs. Frost quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet you ask me to wait,&rdquo; said the squire indignantly. &ldquo;Once for all,
      let me tell you that all entreaties are vain. My mind is made up to
      foreclose, and foreclose I will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be too sure of that,&rdquo; interrupted Frank, with a triumphant smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha, young impudence!&rdquo; exclaimed the squire, wheeling round. &ldquo;Who's to
      prevent me, I should like to know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am,&rdquo; said Frank boldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The squire fingered his cane nervously. He was very strongly tempted to
      lay it on our hero's back. But he reflected that the power was in his
      hands, and that he was sure of his revenge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won't gain anything by your impudence,&rdquo; he said loftily. &ldquo;I might
      have got you a place, out of pity to your mother, if you had behaved
      differently. I need a boy to do odd jobs about the house, and I might have
      offered the place to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you for your kind intentions,&rdquo; said Frank, &ldquo;but I fear the care of
      this farm will prevent my accepting your tempting offer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The care of the farm!&rdquo; repeated the squire angrily. &ldquo;Do you think I will
      delegate it to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't see what you have to do about it,&rdquo; said Frank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you'll find out,&rdquo; roared the squire. &ldquo;I shall take immediate
      possession, and require you to leave at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I suppose we had better pay the mortgage, mother,&rdquo; said Frank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pay the mortgage! You can't do it,&rdquo; said the squire exultingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you the document with you?&rdquo; inquired Mrs. Frost.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, madam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Name the amount due on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With interest eight hundred and twenty-four dollars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frank, call in Mr. Morton as a witness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Morton entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Frank, you may count out the money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; stammered the squire, in dismay, &ldquo;can you pay it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn't you tell me so in the first place?&rdquo; demanded Squire Haynes,
      his wrath excited by his bitter disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wished to ascertain whether your course was dictated by necessity or a
      desire to annoy and injure us. I can have no further doubt about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no help for it. Squire Haynes was compelled to release his hold
      upon the Frost Farm, and pocket his money. He had never been so sorry to
      receive money before.
    </p>
    <p>
      This business over, he was about to beat a hurried retreat, when he was
      suddenly arrested by a question from Henry Morton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you spare me a few minutes, Squire Haynes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am in haste, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My business is important, and has already been too long delayed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too long delayed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it has waited twelve years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't understand you, sir,&rdquo; said the squire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I can assist you. You know me as Henry Morton. That is not my
      real name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An alias!&rdquo; sneered the squire in a significant tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I had my reasons,&rdquo; returned the young man, unmoved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no doubt of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Henry Morton smiled, but did not otherwise notice the unpleasant
      imputation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My real name is Richard Waring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Squire Haynes started violently and scrutinized the young man closely
      through his spectacles. His vague suspicions were confirmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you wish to know my business with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The squire muttered something inaudible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I demand the restitution of the large sum of money entrusted to you by my
      father, just before his departure to the West Indies&mdash;a sum of which
      you have been the wrongful possessor for twelve years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to insult me?&rdquo; exclaimed the squire, bold in the assurance
      that the sole evidence of his fraud was undiscovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unless you comply with my demand I shall proceed against you legally, and
      you are enough of a lawyer to understand the punishment meted out to that
      description of felony.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh, pooh! Your threats won't avail you,&rdquo; said the squire
      contemptuously. &ldquo;Your plan is a very clumsy one. Let me suggest to you,
      young man, that threats for the purpose of extorting money are
      actionable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you doubt my identity?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may very probably be the person you claim to be, but that won't save
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. You have conceded one point.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He walked quietly to the door of the adjoining room, opened it, and in a
      distinct voice called &ldquo;James Travers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the sound of this name Squire Haynes sank into a chair, ashy pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      A man, not over forty, but with seamed face, hair nearly white, and a form
      evidently broken with ill health, slowly entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Squire Haynes beheld him with dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see before you, Squire Haynes, a man whose silence has been your
      safeguard for the last twelve years. His lips are now unsealed. James
      Travers, tell us what you know of the trust reposed in this man by my
      father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said the squire hurriedly. &ldquo;It&mdash;it is enough. I will make
      restitution.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have done wisely,&rdquo; said Richard Waring. (We must give him his true
      name.) &ldquo;When will you be ready to meet me upon this business?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo; muttered the squire.
    </p>
    <p>
      He left the house with the air of one who has been crushed by a sudden
      blow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pride of the haughty had been laid low, and retribution, long
      deferred, had come at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      Numerous and hearty were the congratulations which Mr. Morton&mdash;I mean
      Mr. Waring&mdash;received upon his new accession of property.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not care so much for that,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but my father's word has been
      vindicated. My mind is now at peace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was more than one happy heart at the farm that night. Mr. Waring had
      accomplished the great object of his life; and as for Frank and his
      mother, they felt that the black cloud which had menaced their happiness
      had been removed, and henceforth there seemed prosperous days in store. To
      cap the climax of their happiness, the afternoon mail brought a letter
      from Mr. Frost, in which he imparted the intelligence that he had been
      promoted to a second lieutenancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; said Frank, &ldquo;you must be very dignified now, You are an
      officer's wife.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIII. CONCLUSION
    </h2>
    <p>
      The restitution which Squire Haynes was compelled to make stripped him of
      more than half his property. His mortification and chagrin was so great
      that he determined to remove from Rossville. He gave no intimation where
      he was going, but it is understood that he is now living in the vicinity
      of Philadelphia, in a much more modest way than at Rossville.
    </p>
    <p>
      To anticipate matters a little, it may be said that John was recently
      examined for college, but failed so signally that he will not again make
      the attempt. He has shown a disposition to be extravagant, which, unless
      curbed, will help him run through his father's diminished property at a
      rapid rate whenever it shall come into his possession.
    </p>
    <p>
      The squire's handsome house in Rossville was purchased by Henry Morton&mdash;I
      must still be allowed to call him thus, though not his real name. He has
      not yet taken up his residence there, but there is reason to believe that
      ere long there will be a Mrs. Morton to keep him company therein.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not long since, as he and Frank lay stretched out beneath a
      thick-branching oak in the front yard at the farm, Mr. Morton turned to
      our hero and said, &ldquo;Are you meaning to go to college when your father
      comes home, Frank?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frank hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have always looked forward to it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but lately I have been
      thinking that I shall have to give up the idea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because it is so expensive that my father cannot, in justice to his other
      children, support me through a four years' course. Besides, you know, Mr.
      Morton, we are four hundred dollars in your debt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Should you like very much to go to college, Frank?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better than anything else in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you shall go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frank looked up in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you understand me?&rdquo; said Mr. Morton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean that I will defray your expenses through college.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frank could hardly believe his ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would spend so much money on me!&rdquo; he exclaimed incredulously. &ldquo;Why,
      it will cost a thousand dollars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, I can afford it,&rdquo; said Mr. Morton. &ldquo;But perhaps you object to
      the plan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How good you are to me!&rdquo; said Frank, impulsively seizing his friend's
      hand. &ldquo;What have I done to deserve so much kindness?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have done your duty, Frank, at the sacrifice of your inclinations. I
      think you ought to be rewarded. God has bestowed upon me more than I need.
      I think he intends that I shall become his almoner. If you desire to
      express your gratitude, you can best do it by improving the advantages
      which will be opened to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frank hastened to his mother to communicate his brilliant prospects. Her
      joy was scarcely less than his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not forget, Frank,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;who it is that has raised up this
      friend for you. Give Him the thanks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was another whose heart was gladdened when this welcome news reached
      him in his tent beside the Rappahannock. He felt that while he was doing
      his duty in the field, God was taking better care of his family than he
      could have done if he remained at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before closing this chronicle I must satisfy the curiosity of my readers
      upon a few points in which they may feel interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Rossville Guards are still in existence, and Frank is still their
      captain. They have already done escort duty on several occasions, and once
      they visited Boston, and marched up State Street with a precision of step
      which would have done no discredit to veteran soldiers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dick Bumstead's reformation proved to be a permanent one. He is Frank's
      most intimate friend, and with his assistance is laboring to remedy the
      defects of his early education. He has plenty of ability, and, now that he
      has turned over a new leaf, I have no hesitation in predicting for him a
      useful and honorable career.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Mrs. Payson has left Rossville, much to the delight of her grandson
      Sam, who never could get along with his grandmother. She still wears for
      best the &ldquo;bunnit&rdquo; presented her by Cynthy Ann, which, notwithstanding its
      mishap, seems likely to last her to the end of her natural life. She still
      has a weakness for hot gingerbread and mince pie, and, though she is
      turned of seventy, would walk a mile any afternoon with such an
      inducement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Should any of my readers at any time visit the small town of Sparta, and
      encounter in the street a little old lady dressed in a brown cloak and
      hood, and firmly grasping in her right hand a faded blue cotton umbrella,
      they may feel quite certain that they are in the presence of Mrs.
      Mehitabel Payson, relict of Jeremiah Payson, deceased.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Pomp has improved very much both in his studies and his behavior.
      He now attends school regularly, and is quite as far advanced as most boys
      of his age. Though he is not entirely cured of his mischievous
      propensities, he behaves &ldquo;pretty well, considering,&rdquo; and is a great deal
      of company to old Chloe, to whom he reads stories in books lent him by
      Frank and others. Chloe is amazingly proud of Pomp, whom she regards as a
      perfect prodigy of talent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lor' bress you, missus,&rdquo; she remarked to Mrs. Frost one day, &ldquo;he reads
      jest as fast as I can talk. He's an awful smart boy, dat Pomp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don't you let him teach you to read, Chloe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Lor', missus, I couldn't learn, nohow. I ain't got no gumption. I
      don't know noffin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why couldn't you learn as well as Pomp?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dat ar boy's a gen'us, missus. His fader was a mighty smart nigger, and
      Pomp's took arter him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chloe's conviction of her own inferiority and Pomp's superior ability
      seemed so rooted that Mrs. Frost finally gave up her persuasions.
      Meanwhile, as Chloe is in good health and has abundance of work, she has
      no difficulty in earning a comfortable subsistence for herself and Pomp.
      As soon as Pomp is old enough, Frank will employ him upon the farm.
    </p>
    <p>
      While I am writing these lines intelligence has just been received from
      Frank's substitute at the seat of war. He has just been promoted to a
      captaincy. In communicating this he adds: &ldquo;You may tell Frank that I am
      now his equal in rank, though his commission bears an earlier date. I
      suppose, therefore, I must content myself with being Captain Frost, Jr. I
      shall be very glad when the necessities of the country will permit me to
      lay aside the insignia of rank and, returning to Rossville, subside into
      plain Henry Frost again. If you ask me when this is to be, I can only say
      that it depends on the length of our struggle. I am enlisted for the war,
      and I mean to see it through! Till that time Frank must content himself
      with acting as my substitute at home. I am so well pleased with his
      management of the farm that I am convinced it is doing as well as if I
      were at home to superintend it in person. Express to Mr. Waring my
      gratitude for the generous proposal he has made to Frank. I feel that
      words are inadequate to express the extent of our obligations to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Some years have passed since the above letter was written. The war is
      happily over, and Captain Frost has returned home with an honorable record
      of service. Released from duty at home, Frank has exchanged the farm for
      the college hall, and he is now approaching graduation, one of the
      foremost scholars in his class. He bids fair to carry out the promise of
      his boyhood, and in the more varied and prolonged campaign which manhood
      opens before him we have reason to believe that he will display equal
      fidelity and gain an equal success.

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
